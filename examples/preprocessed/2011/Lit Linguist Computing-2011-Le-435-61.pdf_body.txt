Abstract
We present a large-scale longitudinal study of lexical and syntactic changes in
language in Alzheimer’s disease using complete, fully parsed texts and a large
number of measures, using as our subjects the British novelists Iris Murdoch
(who died with Alzheimer’s), Agatha Christie (who was suspected of it), and P.D.
James (who has aged healthily). We avoid the limitations and deficiencies of
Garrard et al.’s [(2005), The effects of very early Alzheimer’s disease on the
characteristics of writing by a renowned author. Brain, 128 (2): 250–60] earlier
study of Iris Murdoch. Our results support the hypothesis that signs of dementia
can be found in diachronic analyses of patients’ writings, and in addition lead to
new understanding of the work of the individual authors whom we studied.
In particular, we show that it is probable that Agatha Christie indeed suffered
from the onset of Alzheimer’s while writing her last novels, and that Iris Murdoch
exhibited a ‘trough’ of relatively impoverished vocabulary and syntax in her
writing in her late 40s and 50s that presaged her later dementia.

1 Introduction
The research we describe in this article has two
complementary goals. First, we want to determine
whether linguistic markers of Alzheimer’s disease
can be detected in a diachronic analysis of aspects
of an individual’s writing. Our subjects for this are
novelists for whom we have a large, lifelong body
of work. Second, with regard to the individual au-
thors who serve as subjects, we aim to conduct
much larger and more extensive studies than those
of prior research, correcting the deficiencies of
Garrard et al.’s (2005) study of Iris Murdoch, by
using a large corpus and state-of-the-art analysis
methods.
1.1 Motivation, background, and
approach
Alzheimer’s disease, along with other types of de-
mentia, is among the most prevalent geriatric con-
ditions affecting a large proportion of the aging
population. Clinical assessment of dementia, invol-
ving several diagnostic procedures, may be highly
stressful for the individuals undergoing diagno-
sis—yet a definitive diagnosis can be made only
post mortem. But while there is no proven cure
for many types of dementia, a correct, timely diag-
nosis is of great importance; in the future, a suffi-
ciently early diagnosis of AD may even make
prevention possible, according to Blazer and
Steffens (2009): ‘The Alzheimer’s pathology likely
begins many years and perhaps decades before the
onset of symptoms; therefore, there is an opportun-
ity for prevention once future advances make it pos-
sible to diagnose the disease through the use of
biomarkers before symptom onset’ (p. 249).
Recent studies further suggest that early diagno-
sis can also be achieved through linguistic analysis.1
The fact that the disease negatively affects the
linguistic abilities of patients in both speech and
writing presents the possibility of developing non-
intrusive evaluation techniques that require min-
imal involvement from the patients, by looking for
diachronic changes in their writing. If a patient’s
lifelong corpus of writing is available in an online
format, as is likely for future generations, these
techniques could be used in conjunction with
clinical assessments or on their own as an early de-
tection tool.
To test the hypothesis that the disease is detect-
able by a diachronic analysis of a patient’s writing,
we need writing samples from both healthy elderly
adults and diagnosed dementia patients. Each set of
texts must be written by the same individual, be of
substantial length, and span several decades,
from the writer’s youth into his/her late-70s or
80s. While it is difficult to recruit participants in
the present-day general population who have
enough writing samples preserved from before the
digital age to meet our criteria, prolific literary au-
thors provide us with a wealth of data for textual
analysis. Following the lead of Garrard et al. (2005)
(whose work and its limitations we discuss in
Section 1.3 below), we chose the writings of Iris
Murdoch, who died with AD, as the linguistic
model of dementia patients and contrasted it with
the linguistic model of healthily aging adults repre-
sented by the writings of crime fiction author P.D.
James, who, in 2008 at 88 years, her powers un-
diminished and her health not in doubt, published
her latest novel, The Private Patient. Expanding on
work by Lancashire (2010; Lancashire and Hirst
2009) (see Section 1.3), we also analyzed the
novels of Agatha Christie, which present an inter-
esting case study of possible undiagnosed dementia.
1.2 Language in aging and dementia
Alzheimer’s patients suffer from a marked decline
in several cognitive abilities, which may include
memory, orientation, and language comprehension
and production, among other areas, causing pro-
found impact on the patients’ day-to-day function-
ing (Blazer and Steffens, 2009). Healthily aging
adults may also experience a decline in their cogni-
tive abilities, albeit one that is significantly less
severe, and changes in their language (Maxim and
Bryan, 1994; Burke and Shafto, 2008).
Here, we summarize lexical and syntactic changes
in healthy aging and in dementia; a more-detailed
discussion is given by Le (2010). Kemper et al.
(2001) and Burke and Shafto (2008) report that in
healthy aging, vocabulary increases through the
middle adult years, but then may start to decline.
In dementia, vocabulary declines much more

rapidly, especially the use of low-frequency and
more-specific words (Maxim and Bryan, 1994;
Bird et al., 2000; Burke and Shafto, 2008), a conse-
quence of which is that the patient’s noun-to-verb
ratio changes as more low-image verbs are used
(Bird et al., 2000). Moreover, lexical repetitions in-
crease (Nicholas et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1989;
Holm et al., 1994; Cook et al., 2009); ideas from
previous utterances are often reiterated in the
same words, phrases, or even short sentences,
either as perseverations or as ‘markers when other
lexical items are not available’ (Maxim and Bryan,
1994, p. 183); fillers (um, ah) and dysfluencies in-
crease (Burke and Shafto, 2008).
The syntactic complexity of language, defined
by measures such as clauses per utterance, declines
with age in both spoken and written language
(Burke and Shafto, 2008). Maxim and Bryan
(1994) report that left-branching clauses in
English are more difficult for elderly adults to pro-
cess than for a younger control group. Kemper
et al. (2001), in a longitudinal study following lin-
guistic changes in healthy elders and dementia pa-
tients, found decline in grammatical complexity to
be far more rapid in the latter. Bates et al. (1995)
found that use of the passive voice, in particular,
was affected, with healthy elders producing fewer
passives than a younger control group, and
Alzheimer’s patients far fewer again. Moreover,
the AD group used more agentless passives (e.g.,
John was fired or John got fired) than either of the
control groups, and also relied heavily on the get
form of the passive.
In summary, while heterogeneity is expected in
the linguistic changes among individuals in both
normal aging and dementia, and while different
studies have offered different theories regarding
the linguistic components that undergo change,
the consensus is that any decline that may occur
in normal aging is accelerated in the presence of
dementia. The distinguishing feature between a
disease-related linguistic deficit and the natural de-
cline associated with advancing age, then, is the rate
of change, which is more gradual and less severe in
healthily aging adults. In the case of dementia, def-
icits in lexical features may be more prominent than
in syntactic ones, since a core of linguistic ability is
possibly spared until the later stages of the disease
progression.
1.3 Related work
In recent years, several longitudinal studies have
been conducted with focus on individual writers,
in order to examine their patterns of linguistic
changes over time. For example, Williams et al.
(2003) analyzed fifty-seven letters written by the
seventeenth-century monarch King James VI/I
within the last twenty years of his life to assess
whether the linguistic cues in these letters reflected
normal aging, AD, or vascular dementia. The study
did not produce a conclusive diagnosis.
In a similar case study on a contemporary sub-
ject, Garrard et al. (2005) examined works by the
late English author Iris Murdoch, whose diagnosis
of AD a few years before her death was confirmed
post mortem. Murdoch’s last novel Jackson’s
Dilemma, published shortly before her diagnosis, is
widely believed by researchers, literary critics, and
readers to contain indicators of her declining cog-
nitive health.2 Along with this novel, Garrard et al.
sampled two of Murdoch’s earlier works: her first
published novel Under the Net, and one written at
the height of her career, The Sea, the Sea. However,
the linguistic analysis conducted suffered from
serious problems in methodology (see Le, 2010 for
a more-detailed critique).
The first problem is the data used for analysis,
which consisted of the complete texts of Under the
Net and Jackson’s Dilemma, but, for unexplained
reasons, only about 20% of The Sea, the Sea (the
first 100 pages). Length-based measures were extra-
polated from this sample on the questionable as-
sumption that the remaining 80% of the novel
was identical in structure to the first 20% (indeed,
we found, in our experiments below, that the pro-
jected word count was off by nearly 7000 tokens).
Then, despite having 2.2 full novels available,
much of the analysis was just carried out manually
on tiny samples from the texts. Average word
length, average word frequency, and grammatical
class proportions were computed from five
100-word samples from each novel. The results of
these measures are therefore not reliable. Moreover,
the grammatical class of each word was determined

not by conventional context-dependent part-of-
speech tagging, but by simply selecting ‘‘the more
typical reading’’ out of four categories—noun, verb,
descriptor, and function word—regardless of con-
text (p. 253). The accuracy of this approximation is
uncertain, since relatively few English words belong
to only one word class. For the remaining measures
performed by hand, Garrard et al. used a different
sample set; the first ten sentences from the first,
middle, and final chapters of each book were ex-
tracted as data for two measures of syntactic com-
plexity: the mean number of words per sentence and
the mean number of clauses per sentence. The ra-
tionale for this choice—that the segments were
‘‘similarly sized samples from equivalent points in
the three books’’—is unsound; as the researchers
themselves pointed out, the results of these meas-
ures ‘‘would have been influenced not only by the
book’s overall syntactic complexity, but also by the
local thematic context’’ (p. 255).
Garrard et al.’s remaining measures (on the com-
plete 2.2 texts) included a variation of type/token
ratio, which computes the number of unique word
types at every 10,000 word-token interval. This
measure revealed an impoverishment in vocabulary
in the first 40,000 tokens of Jackson’s Dilemma, rela-
tive to similar-sized portions of the two earlier
novels, and a slower rate of new word-type accretion
in Jackson’s Dilemma compared to Under the Net.
Their final measure, termed auto-collocations, com-
putes the proportion of times the ten most common
words were repeated within a space of four subse-
quent words. Since the most common repetitions
are inevitably function words, this measure was clas-
sified as a syntactic analysis technique; however,
little conclusion can be drawn from it with regards
to syntactic complexity. Overall, the study con-
tended that, while few disparities were found in
the structure and the syntax, marked and consistent
variations existed in the lexical analysis of the small
samples randomly drawn from the three novels.3
In work that led to the project to be described in
this article (and whose results are incorporated into
Section 3 below), Lancashire (2010; Lancashire and
Hirst 2009) analyzed 15 complete novels by Agatha
Christie from 1922 to 1973 in late 2007 and de-
tected, in her last novels (especially Elephants Can
Remember and Postern of Fate), both written in her
early 80s, a sizable loss of vocabulary as well as large
increases in phrasal repetitions and indefinite
nouns. Both novels work out the clues and plot of
their murders with difficulty; and the female leading
character of Elephants writes detective fiction and
complains of a deteriorating memory. Biographies
suggest that in Christie’s 80s, her daughter forbade
her publisher to ask for more novels, her health
markedly declined, and some hinted at senility
(see Morgan, 1984, pp. 370–71 and Lancashire
2010), although she was never diagnosed with AD.
1.4 Our goals and hypotheses
Because we are looking at published text, we are
looking for early signs of dementia (when publish-
able writing is still possible). We focused, then, on
lexical and syntactic markers: vocabulary size, repe-
tition, word specificity, word-class deficit, fillers,
grammatical complexity, and the use of passive.
We expect that Murdoch’s data will exhibit the
linguistic patterns of dementia patients and P.D.
James’s data the linguistic patterns of healthy
aging described in Section 1.2 above, as summarized
in Table 1. Further, we hypothesize that Agatha
Christie’s data will show patterns of decline similar
to those of AD patients.
To avoid the problems evident in Garrard et al.’s
study, we used far larger corpora—the complete text
of fifteen to twenty novels by each author—with a
complete syntactic analysis of each text and
more-meaningful measures of lexical and syntactic
complexity.
2 Materials
2.1 Data
We analyzed twenty of Murdoch’s twenty-six
novels, published between ages 35 and 76
(M¼ 52.7), sixteen of Christie’s novels written
between ages 28 and 82 (M¼ 59.0), and fifteen of
the novels of P.D. James, published between ages 42
and 82 (M¼ 63.9). The Appendix lists the fifty-one
novels, with publication years and estimated ages of
the authors at composition. Apart from Christie’s
Curtain, written in the early 1940s but published
only in the mid-1970s, we assume, given no

evidence to the contrary, that each novel was written
just prior to the year of its publication. All texts
belong to the same genre, prose fiction, and in all
cases, the novels span the author’s career.
The text of two of Christie’s novels, The
Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920) and Secret
Adversary (1922), came from Project Gutenberg;
all the others were scanned and converted to plain
text with commercial optical character recognition
(OCR) software (the Christie novels with OmniPage
Professional 15.0, and the others with ABBYY
FineReader 9.0 Professional Edition). We corrected
OCR errors in spelling and punctuation manu-
ally, and then common error patterns semi-
automatically with an interactive script.
The experiments to be described below require
various levels of processing of the resulting text files,
ranging from simple unlemmatized word sequences
through lemmatized sequences and part-of-speech
tagging to complete syntactic analyses. Given the
plain text file of a novel, we first separated punctu-
ation marks and clitics from the word tokens to
which they are attached (e.g. I ’m, is n’t, John ’s),
and lemmatized the words with NLTK WordNet’s
morphy method (Bird et al., 2009). We then deter-
mined sentence boundaries with a rule-based, deter-
ministic algorithm. Then a parse tree was generated
for each sentence, using the Charniak (2006) parser,
which includes part-of-speech tagging as a subpro-
cess. Finally, a script was run on the parse trees to
correct common patterns of error made by the
parser. For detailed descriptions of the implemen-
tation, see Le (2010).
2.2 Impact of writing process and
genre on reliability
Our experiments assume that the text we are analyz-
ing is solely that of the author whom we want to
study, without any influence from a collaborating
writer or any significant alteration by an editor. In
addition, the process by which the author composed
might affect the linguistic markers being analyzed.
Agatha Christie’s writing process changed over
time. She wrote her earlier novels in longhand and
then typed them on a typewriter (after hiring a sec-
retary to take dictation for a brief period), but, on
breaking her wrist in 1952, she began using a
Dictaphone. She wrote in her autobiography that
subsequent removal of repetitions made during
the recording was ‘‘irritating’’ since it ‘‘destroys
the smooth flow which one gets otherwise’’
(Christie, 1977, p. 348). Her editing routine might
have changed again at the time she composed her
second-last novel, Elephants can Remember, when
she broke her hip, and for her final novel, Postern
of Fate, her agent requested that Christie receive
editing help (Morgan, 1984, p. 371).
All the novels that Christie wrote under her
own name4 are of the detective genre, except for
the political spy thriller Passenger to Frankfurt: An
Extravaganza (1970). Lancashire (2010; Lancashire

and Hirst, 2009) observed that this novel has a far
larger vocabulary than her detective novels, owing
to the extensive research into relevant political lit-
erature that Christie carried out while composing it,
thus enriching it with a vocabulary beyond her own.
Lancashire and Hirst (2009) considered this novel
an outlier (since it departed from the detective-
novel genre) and so excluded it from the dataset
they used to measure vocabulary. We follow the
same view here only with regard to vocabulary;
there is no a priori reason to consider this novel
an outlier with regard to syntax.
Iris Murdoch wrote in longhand, without a type-
writer or word processor, after months of working
out the plot, and apparently neither ‘‘agonized over
choice of words, indulged in repeated revisions of
passages, [nor] made extensive use of a dictionary or
thesaurus’’ (Garrard et al., 2005, p. 252). She denied
anyone else the right to edit her writings, even her
publishers.
P.D. James begins with months of ‘‘plotting and
planning’’ sketched in a notebook, penning out-of-
order sequences by hand, putting the book together,
and then dictating it to a secretary (James, 2010).
Little is known about her editorial process, apart
from her use of a dictionary and a thesaurus.
However, James commented that she found the
writing process of her latest novel easy, and there
is no reason to believe that she relied unusually on
reference sources or that her writing is significantly
modified by an editor.
To the best of our knowledge, except as noted
above, no novel in our dataset departs from the
usual writing methodology of its author, belongs
to an atypical genre, or involves research to the
degree that it should be judged an outlier.
3 Lexical analysis
In this section, we present five analyses of the novels
at the lexical level, using a variety of measures that
will be explained in the sections below. To look for
changes over time in each of the measures, we per-
formed simple linear regression of the measure
against the author’s age, and tested each regression
model for a statistically significant relationship
between the author’s age and the value of the meas-
ure. We tested correlation between measures with
the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient
method.
Some of the measures that we used are sensitive
to text length and therefore required a cut-off
threshold. For example, in the case of vocabulary
richness, a 60,000-word novel will not have twice
as many unique word-types as a 30,000-word nov-
ella, since the number of word-types does not grow
linearly with the number of word-tokens (the
second half of the 60,000-word novel is bound to
‘‘reuse’’ many word-types of the first half). As each
text in our dataset contains at least 55,000 tokens,
except for Murdoch’s The Italian Girl with 48,448
tokens, for length-sensitive measures, we considered
only the first 55,000 tokens of each text, and
excluded The Italian Girl to avoid lowering the
token count. For the remaining measures, we used
the complete text of all the novels. In our graphs,
the outlier in the Christie dataset, Passenger to
Frankfurt, is excluded from the overall trend but
included as a single datapoint.
3.1 Vocabulary size
We measured the vocabulary size of each novel
by the type/token ratio (TTR), i.e. the number of
unique lemmatized word-types divided by the total
number of word-tokens, and by the word-type
introduction rate (WTIR), i.e. the cumulative
number of unique lemmatized types computed at
every 10,000-token interval.
Figure 1 displays the TTR variations of each
author over time. Murdoch’s ratio drops at the
age of 50, and then begins to rise and peak in her
mid-60s at The Sea, the Sea, before plummeting
with her last novel, Jackson’s Dilemma, written in
her 75th year. Although the dataset as a whole
does not exhibit a statistically significant change
[F(1,19)¼ 0.19, P¼ 0.6651], Murdoch’s first 15
novels, excluding The Italian Girl, show a significant
rise [F(1,13)¼ 13.41, P¼ 0.0029], while in the last
five novels, the decreasing trend is steeper and also
significant [F(1,3)¼ 14.17, P¼ 0.0328]. Christie’s
ratios vary between 0.07 and 0.084 before her
60s, and then begin to drop, reaching bottom at
her second last novel, Elephants Can Remember.

A significant decline [F(1,13)¼ 9.29, P¼ 0.0093] is
found for the entire period, excluding Passenger to
Frankfurt, whose TTR is higher than Christie’s other
novels. P.D. James’s TTR varies in the 0.09 to 0.11
range with no signs of decline; the slight rising
trend is statistically insignificant [F(1,13)¼ 0.59,
P¼ 0.4550].
Word-type introduction rates appear in Figs 2
and 3. Each line reflects the vocabulary growth of
one novel measured at every 10,000-word-token
interval. Lines may overlap, and their clustering in-
dicates some consistency. Each author’s novels are
divided into two groups, earlier and later, the
former represented as dotted lines and the latter
as solid lines. For Christie, this division coincides
with her change of writing method, from the type-
writer to the Dictaphone. Her novels, containing
from 55,000 to under 80,000 word tokens, are mea-
sured up to a maximum of 70,000 tokens. For a fair
comparison, the graphs for Murdoch and James
in Fig. 2 are scaled to focus on the first 70,000
tokens; the graphs for the complete novels are
shown in Fig. 3.
Murdoch’s last novel, Jackson’s Dilemma, has an
unusually low rate of vocabulary growth compared
to her previous works, all of which (with the excep-
tion of The Philosopher’s Pupil) cluster together in a
concentrated band. This confirms the TTR results
that the decline in Murdoch’s vocabulary occurred
abruptly, and is consistent with Garrard et al. (2005)

in that this decline is evident in Jackson’s Dilemma.
Employing similar methods, our longitudinal ap-
proach reveals additionally that the decline became
severe while she was writing this last novel; Fig. 3a
shows that the vocabulary growth of Jackson’s
Dilemma slows down significantly only after the
40,000th token, as distinguished from most of
Murdoch’s works.
A more gradual declining tendency appears in
Christie’s last two novels, Elephants Can Remember
(which has the slowest rate of growth) and Postern
of Fate. All of Christie’s earlier works stay in the
upper range, while most of her later works (except
for Destination Unknown and The Clocks) occupy
the lower range, indicating a progressive impover-
ishment of vocabulary. For P.D. James, a different
picture emerges. The rates are relatively consistent,
with earlier and later works intertwined, apart from
her first two novels, which stand out in a slightly
lower range. James’s most recent novel remains in
the mid-range up to the 50,000-token mark, then
converges towards her lower range from the
60,000-token mark onwards, but does not greatly
depart from her usual rate.
Statistical tests comparing increasing-sized por-
tions among all the novels confirm a sharp decline
in the word-type introduction rate in Christie’s
works over time (P < 0.0083 for blocks of up to
50,000 words). No significant trends are found for
Murdoch and James.
Table 2 shows the correlation between TTR and
WTIR measured at various points in each text.
A very strong correlation with high significance is
found when WTIR is evaluated at the 50,000th
token, even when many of Murdoch’s and James’s
novels fall between 100,000 and 220,000 in token
count. The results of both measures highlight the
fact that Murdoch’s last novel and Christie’s last
two share a common characteristic: their vocabulary
sizes deviate from the norms set by the authors’
earlier works. Murdoch’s decline is abrupt, while
Christie’s is more gradual over time.
3.2 Lexical repetition
While an author sometimes uses deliberate repeti-
tion for effect, an increasing rate of lexical repetition
may indicate a reduced vocabulary or word-retrieval
difficulties. We performed two analyses: global and
local.
The first measured an author’s tendency to
repeat by counting global word n-gram repetitions,
that is, phrases containing from two to eleven words
that occur at least twice at any point in a text. (We
are using the word phrase here to refer to word
n-grams, not syntactic constituents.) We extracted
all fixed phrasal repetitions, as defined by length in

words and frequency (Lancashire et al., 1996, p. 97)
in the first 55,000 tokens of each novel. We define
maximals to be the longest repeating fixed phrases
in a text that are not found inside any other repeat-
ing fixed phrase, and associates to be substrings of
maximals that occur more frequently than those
maximals. Figure 4 shows that Christie’s unique
repeated phrases of both types, maximals, and
associates, rose by about 800 over her career
(8,567–9,346), a significant increase [F(1,13)¼
8.53, P¼ 0.0119] that peaked at 9,827 in
Elephants. Although Murdoch’s repeating phrases,
like James’s, fell overall, but not significantly
[F(1,17)¼ 1.27, P¼ 0.2760], repetitions rose again
in the last five Murdoch novels, peaking in Jackson’s
Dilemma.
The second analysis measured local repetition:
the proportion of lemmatized open-class words
(i.e. nouns, content verbs, adjectives, and adverbs)
repeated within 10 subsequent open-class words,
computed over the number of all content words in
each novel. Figure 5 shows the results. Murdoch’s
overall repetition rate increases significantly, peak-
ing in her 51st year, and again rising in her last two
novels. Christie’s repetition rates rise more steeply,
with high certainty, peaking in her last two novels,
of which 14.53% and 13.83% of the content
word-tokens are repeated within close distance;
this stands in sharp contrast to the rates of 7.14%
and 5.96% in her first two novels. Repetition rates
in James’s novels remain relatively stable in the low
range (5.54–7.26%). When the distance is extended
to 20 subsequent content words, similar patterns are
observed in all three authors, as indicated by the
coefficient values in Table 3. The rise is pronounced
in Christie, slightly less steep in Murdoch—both
with statistical significance—and marginal without
significance in James.
Table 4 displays the correlation between rates of
lexical repetition of distance 20 and the other
vocabulary measures, PR (phrasal repetition),
TTR, and WTIR at 50,000 tokens. As predicted,
repetition rate is negatively correlated with vocabu-
lary size, although only Christie’s results show a
strong and highly significant correlation. A milder
negative correlation with significance is found be-
tween James’s lexical repetition and TTR. The rise in
Murdoch’s repetition rates after the 60-year mark
coincides with the drop in TTR, while the earlier
portions are not as well-correlated. At the 51-year
mark (A Fairly Honorable Defeat), Murdoch’s repe-
tition rates climb to a peak at both distances 10 and
20, while her TTRs are also in a trough then.
3.3 Lexical specificity
We approximate lexical specificity by computing
the proportions of indefinite nouns and of
high-frequency, low-imageability verb tokens in

words

each text. A higher proportion indicates greater re-
liance on generic words and, consequently, a lower
overall specificity rank. We considered four indef-
inite nouns—thing(s), something, anything,
nothing—and 35 high-frequency verbs of relatively
low specificity, in their base and conjugated forms
[the first 14 of which are present in the writing
samples of semantic dementia patients (Bird et al.,
2000)]:
be, come, do, get, give, go, have, know, look,
make, see, tell, think, want, ask, feel, find,
forget, happen, hear, like, live, mean, meet,
put, remember, run, say, seem, speak, suppose,
take, use, walk, wonder.
Figure 6, which displays the number of indefinite
nouns, shows a slight and gradual increase for most
of Christie’s writing career, with an abrupt climb to
a peak in her last two novels, constituting a highly
significant trend [F(1,13)¼ 14.44, P¼ 0.0022]. Both
Murdoch’s and James’s usage of indefinite nouns
decreases over time, although James’s rates are
more consistent and hence statistically significant
[F(1,13)¼ 8.07, P¼ 0.0139], while Murdoch’s fluc-
tuate [F(1,17)¼ 0.63, P¼ 0.4368].
Figure 7 displays the percentages of the indefinite
verbs in the first 55,000 tokens of each novel.
Christie’s rates show a marked increase, from a
low of 48% for The Secret Adversary (1922), to a
high of 71% for Elephants Can Remember (1971)
[F(1,13)¼ 55.74, P < 0.0001]. That thirty-five verb-
types account for 71% of all verb-tokens in a novel
of nearly 62,000 words suggests a severe deficit in

verbs, due to either word-retrieval problems or
an impoverished vocabulary. Christie’s extensive
research for Passenger to Frankfurt greatly reduced
the percentage of these verbs: at 59%, Frankfurt has
the lowest rate among Christie novels in a period of
15 years. In contrast, the results for Murdoch and
James remain relatively stable below 53%. For
Murdoch, a moderate decrease of high significance
is found [F(1,17)¼ 12.13, P < 0.0028], while James’s
slight decreasing trend is statistically insignificant
[F(1,13)¼ 0.53, P¼ 0.4789].
Table 5 shows these approximations to be signifi-
cantly correlated with the lexical repetition measure
and negatively correlated with the vocabulary meas-
ures for both Christie and James, showing that a
larger vocabulary entails fewer lexical repetitions
and less reliance on common verbs of low
specificity.
3.4 Word-class deficit
In this section, we look at the proportions of each
word class over the entire length of each text, in
terms of both word-tokens, in order to look for
signs of deficit in or reliance on individual classes,
and word-types, in order to measure vocabulary size
of open classes.
Figures 8–12 display the changes in the propor-
tions of nouns, pronouns, content verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs, in terms of token count and type
count. Table 6 shows the results of statistical signifi-
cance tests for each word class of interest, and
Tables 7 and 8 report the correlation coefficients
between the different word classes.
In contrast to Garrard et al. (2005), whose ap-
proximation of grammatical class proportion found
no significant differences among three of Murdoch’s
novels, our analysis, using full, context-aware
part-of-speech tagging, discovers longitudinal vari-
ations in the datapoints. Among the important
findings are a decline in noun-token proportion
and a rise in verb-token proportion in both
Murdoch’s and Christie’s novels (Figs 8a and 9a).

These trends are statistically significant, with
P-value between 0.0076 and 0.0469 (Table 6). Our
statistical tests also showed a negative correlation
between the noun and verb proportions of the two
authors, which is stronger and more significant in
Christie’s results (Table 7). Similar correlations
occur in semantic dementia patients (Bird et al.,
2000) in that the apparent noun deficit is compen-
sated for by a rise in verbs. On the other hand, no
significant trend is found in James’s noun propor-
tion and, although verb proportion shows a slight
increasing tendency with high significance, the two
values are not highly correlated. Nor are the pro-
portions of pronouns and that of common nouns
for all three authors, as shown in Table 7.
However, when proper nouns are considered
together with common nouns, a strong negative
correlation is found between noun-token propor-
tion and pronoun-token proportion for all three
authors (Table 7). Figure 8 presents the changes in
percentage over time. Again, very few variations
exist across James’s novels, while Murdoch’s and
Christie’s results span a wide range. As Table 6
shows, a significant decreasing tendency is found

in Christie’s noun-token results, largely due to the
sudden drop in her 1967 novel, Endless Night. These
observations, unsurprisingly, suggest that the deficit
in nouns is remedied by increased use of pronouns,
in addition to the previously mentioned rise in verb
proportion.
An opposite tendency is observed when types
are considered instead of tokens (Figs 8b and 9b).
Noun proportions increase while verb proportions
decrease for all three authors in varying degrees.
These trends are all significant, except for
Murdoch’s noun proportion (Table 6). Christie’s
results have the steepest rate of change and a
strong negative correlation between noun and
verb, while for Murdoch and James, the change is
more gradual and the correlation less pronounced.
This fact, combined with the vocabulary and
high-frequency verb results, suggests that the decline
in Christie’s vocabulary is more dramatic for verbs
than for nouns, causing an increase in noun-type
proportion (which does not necessarily signify a
growth in noun vocabulary).

Similarly, a disconnection between type and
token exists in the proportions of adjectives and
adverbs (Figs 11 and 12). While the adjective token
proportions remain relatively stable, wide variations
are observed in type proportions for all three au-
thors, although none of these trends is statistically
significant. An abrupt drop can be seen in Murdoch’s
and Christie’s type proportions in their later novels.

With regard to adverbs, Murdoch’s and
Christie’s token proportions exhibit a statistically
significant increase, while James’s rates decline
slightly. When types are considered, all three au-
thors have a decreasing tendency overall which, as
shown in Table 6, is steepest and highly significant
for Christie, moderate and significant for James, and
slightest and approaching significance for Murdoch.
Tables 7 and 8 report the correlation coefficients
between different word classes in token and in type.
The rise of verb-token proportion in Christie’s
novels is positively correlated with the rise of ad-
verb-token proportion, while this is not the case for
Murdoch and James. In light of our high-frequency
verb results, which show that Christie relied heavily
on common, less-specific verbs in her later novels,
this increased usage of adverbs was perhaps a
remedy for the reduced number of specific verbs
available in her active vocabulary.
3.5 Fillers
Our final lexical measure is the proportion of words
identified in part-of-speech tagging as interjections
and fillers. While these words largely appear in the
dialogue portions of the novels, fiction authors usu-
ally attempt to create natural dialogues in their
prose, and thus their characters’ conversational
styles arguably reflect, to some extent, their own
styles. Nonetheless, this measure may reflect an au-
thor’s stylistic choice rather than a cognitive decline
and therefore should be interpreted cautiously.
The proportions of lexical fillers and interjections
are shown in Fig. 13. Consistent with our pre-
diction, Murdoch’s and Christie’s data indicates
clear rising tendencies that are both significant
[F(1,18)¼ 10.98, P¼ 0.0039 and F(1,14)¼ 6.22,
P¼ 0.0258, respectively]. While the rates of
Murdoch’s last two novels are only slightly higher
than her average results, Christie’s rates surge in her
last two novels to a peak of 1.67, which is more than
double the average of her earlier works (0.79), and
nearly triples the lowest rate seen in her 30s (0.55).
James’s data, on the contrary, remains consistently
low throughout, following a slight decreasing trend
that is not statistically significant [F(1,13)¼ 1.60,
P¼ 0.2282].
As Table 9 shows, this measure is moderately
correlated, with statistical significance, with other
lexical measures for Christie: the correlation is nega-
tive for the vocabulary measures—type/token ratio
(TTR) and word-type introduction rate (WTIR)—
and positive for lexical repetitions (LR), phrasal
repetitions (PR), indefinite nouns (IN), and
high-frequency verb proportions (HFV). These re-
sults make intuitive sense: a high rate of fillers may
indicate word-finding difficulty, which reduces vo-
cabulary size, increases repetitions, and leads to a

greater reliance on generic verbs. For James, a simi-
lar correlation is found between this measure and
most other measures, except for lexical repetition,
whereas for Murdoch the situation is reversed.
Because of the varying degrees of correlation, we
neither reject these results nor use them as a basis
for our conclusion.
4 Syntactic analysis
Most of our syntactic measures operate on parse
trees, one for each sentence in a text, generated by
the Charniak parser. As in the lexical analysis, we
performed simple linear regression on each set of
results and tested them for statistical significance.
Correlation between measures was also computed
with the Spearman correlation coefficient method.
None of the novels was excluded or considered an
outlier.
4.1 Syntactic complexity
Syntactic complexity is assessed by several measures,
described below, that have been shown to be sensi-
tive to the effects of aging (Cheung and Kemper,
1992). However, the dialogues in novels may com-
plicate analysis of syntactic complexity. Fiction wri-
ters often try to capture the essence of natural,
real-life conversations in their dialogues. Because
spoken language tends to have lower complexity,
with shorter sentences, fewer embedded clauses,
less complex grammar, and more fragments, the
proportion of dialogue in each novel may partly
determine its complexity scores. Ideally, we would
perform separate syntactic analysis on the dialogue
portions and the narrative portions; however, this
separation of dialogue from narrative cannot be ac-
complished, given the limitations of our scanned
texts (see Le, 2010 for a detailed discussion of the
problems). Consequently, the results of these meas-
ures should be interpreted cautiously.
4.1.1 Mean length of utterance and
mean number of clauses per utterance
For each sentence parse tree, the number of words
and the number of clauses (main, subordinate, and
embedded) are counted. (Contractions, such as is
n’t and they ’re, count as two words.) Mean length
of utterance (MLU) and mean number of clauses
per utterance (MCU) are the respective averages
over all sentences in a text.
The MLU results of all three authors show
increasing tendencies, but none are statistically sig-
nificant. Murdoch’s mean sentence length reaches a
peak early in her career, plummets to a low at age
51 years with Defeat (which overlaps with Christie’s
datapoint for Towards Zero at age 51 years in
Fig. 14—the two points are indistinguishable in
the figure), and gradually recovers in her later
works before dropping slightly with her final two
novels. On the other hand, Christie’s sentence
length stays relatively stable before climbing to a
peak at age 80 years, and then declines to her
usual range with her last novel. James’s mean sen-
tence length fluctuates between 13.18 and 14.76 and
reaches its peak at her most recent work.

The MCU data (Fig. 15) show a significant over-
all increasing trend for Christie and James.
Christie’s syntax is relatively lower in number of
clauses, which fluctuate between 1.65 and 1.93
before rising in her last few novels to a maximum
of 2.13. James’s results also hint at an upward trend,
varying between 2.07 and 2.45, and peaking at her
most recent novel. Murdoch’s overall trend is insig-
nificant because of an unexpected deep drop around
her late-40s and 50s, of which the lowest point is at
the 51-year mark with her 1970 novel, A Fairly
Honorable Defeat.
4.1.2 Parse tree depth and Yngve depths
The parse tree depth measure computes the average
maximum depths of the parse trees of the sentences
in each complete novel. This reflects the average
number of embedded structures in a sentence, in
order to approximate syntactic complexity, relying
on the assumption that deeply nested levels of
embedding are associated with complex sentences.
Figure 16 displays the average unweighted parse tree
depth of each novel. Murdoch’s results follow a pat-
tern similar to those of her MCU and MLU results: a
brief rise in the early novels, a steep drop in her 40s
and 50s, followed by a period of recovery and a drop
in her last novels; the overall trend is a statistically
insignificant decrease. In contrast, the parse tree
depths of Christie’s novels constitute a significant
increase, which is in part due to the sharp rise in
her later novels. James’s average depth remains con-
sistent throughout her career and increases slightly
in her two most recent novels; the overall increasing
trend is insignificant.
One drawback of this simple measure is the
equal weight it assigns to left-branching and right-
branching structures, while, given the nature of the
English language, left-branching structures are more
complex and put a heavier requirement on working
memory (Kemper et al., 2001). Therefore, we also
used an asymmetric measure that compensates for
left-branching structures, the Yngve (1960) meas-
ure, which assigns a higher score for left-branching
syntax than for right-branching. However, the re-
sults of this measure were essentially the same as
those of the regular depth measure previously
described; see Le (2010) for details.
4.1.3 D-Level
Originally constructed by Rosenberg and Abbeduto
(1987), the D-Level scale is a psycholinguistics-
based ranking of sentence types into eight levels
of increasing syntactic complexity. Cheung and
Kemper (1992) and Covington et al. (2006) ad-
dressed some problems in the original scale and
proposed modifications to better model incremental
levels of complexity. Our implementation, based on
the revised version of D-Level by Covington et al.

(2006; and detailed in Le 2010), uses pattern-
matching to determine whether a parse tree matches
the constructions indicative of each level. Each parse
tree is given a score between 0 and 7, and these
scores are averaged over the entire novel.
Figure 17 displays results of the D-Level measure,
which are largely similar to the results of other syn-
tactic measures. Murdoch’s average D-Level scores
over time exhibit a very slight, statistically insignifi-
cant decrease. In contrast, statistical tests indicate
an upward trend that approaches significance for
Christie [F(1,14)¼ 4.46, P¼ 0.0531], and one that
is highly significant for James [F(1,13)¼ 6.33,
P¼ 0.0258].
As summarized in Table 10, few of the syntactic
complexity measures yield statistically significant
results. This reflects the lack of linear rising or fall-
ing trends in the data; Murdoch’s D-Level results,
for instance, are best represented by a cubic regres-
sion model, rather than linear and quadratic
models, as demonstrated in Fig. 17b.

tween the complexity measures, which are mostly

moderate to high, especially for Murdoch. The
high level of agreement among different measures
reconfirms that, compared to her earlier works,
Murdoch’s syntactic complexity undergoes a
period of relatively steep decrease around the au-
thor’s late-40s and 50s, followed by a period of grad-
ual increase in her later novels.
4.2 Passive voice
We approximated the frequency of passive voice
usage by counting the number of sentences contain-
ing a be-passive, a get-passive or a past participle
verb followed by a by-phrase. Bare passives (those
not headed by be or get—such as the verb headed in
this clause) often cannot be distinguished from the
perfect use of past participles if not accompanied by
a by-phrase. The same pattern-matching algorithm
used for the D-Level measure identifies the three
passive forms (see Le, 2010 for details). The measure
reports the percentage of sentences containing pas-
sive forms over the total number of sentences, as
well as the percentages of each passive form over
all passive sentences. Note that, because a passive
sentence may contain both a be-passive and a get-
passive, the percentages of be- and get-passives for
each novel do not necessarily sum to 100%.
Figure 18a shows the proportion of sentences
containing these passive forms over the total
number of sentences in each text. James’s results
indicate a slight upward trend, while Murdoch’s
and Christie’s exhibit a decline. None of these
trends is statistically significant, as summarized in
Table 12. Christie’s decline, however, approaches
significance with a P-value of 0.0541.

Table 13 shows that this measure is moderately
correlated with most syntactic complexity measures
for Murdoch and James, but clearly not for Christie.
This suggests that access to passive forms may be
affected by the overall complexity of one’s syntax.
Similar to the complexity results, Murdoch’s passive
proportion is best modelled by cubic regression, as
demonstrated by Figure 18b, which is consistent
with the previous observation of a syntactic decline
in her 50s.
Figure 19a and b show the proportion of passive
sentences that contain the verbs be and get, respect-
ively. The proportions of be-passives in Murdoch’s
and Christie’s novels both exhibit a declining trend,
which is stronger and statistically significant for
Murdoch. James’s be-passives, on the other hand,
increase in proportion, though without significance.
With respect to get-passives, a mild increase
exists in Murdoch’s and James’s results, whereas
Christie’s results, in contrast, follow a strong,
highly significant rising pattern, peaking abruptly
in her 1967 novel, Endless Night. Proportions of
passives with by-phrase, shown in Figure 20, suggest
a moderate decline over time for Christie, a very
slight decline for James and, surprisingly, a signifi-
cant increase for Murdoch. Statistical test results for
these measures are given in Table 12.
5 Discussion
In this section, we discuss our results with respect to
the hypotheses of Table 1. A summary is shown in
Table 14.
5.1 Lexical analysis
Our lexical analysis results largely support our
hypotheses and the expected lexical patterns of lin-
guistic change given in Table 1. TTR and WTIR in
Murdoch’s later novels indicate her lexical decline,

especially in Jackson’s Dilemma, with an abrupt drop
in vocabulary size in the second half of the book.
As expected, the decline in vocabulary leads to a
significant increase in lexical repetitions of content
words, and a word-class deficit can be seen in
noun-token proportion, with a compensatory
increase in verb-token proportion. Murdoch’s
repeating phrases decline until she is in her
mid-60s, when they rise steadily and peak with
Jackson’s Dilemma. Unexpectedly, in 1969–70,
more than twenty years before Alzheimer’s symp-
toms became clear, her vocabulary declined (see sec-
tion 5.3 below). The first signs of her final
vocabulary decline appear in The Green Knight
(1993), composed ca. 1992, five years before her
diagnosis of AD, and seven years before her death.
But contrary to our prediction, her lexical specificity
remained intact.
The lexical results of James’s novels follow the
patterns expected for normal aging elders. Her vo-
cabulary, repetition, and specificity scores vary only
in a relatively small range, with no apparent
word-class deficit. Vocabulary growth of the latter
half of James’s most recent book, The Private
Patient, tapers slightly but does not stray far from
her average range.

Christie’s vocabulary, repetition, and specificity
measures show an overall decline with just two
exceptions, Destination Unknown (1954, at age
63 years) and the known outlier, Passenger to
Frankfurt (1970, at age 79 years). The latter exhibits
the largest vocabulary of the 16 Christie novels we
analyzed, the highest word-type introduction rate,
and fewer lexical repetitions and high-frequency
verbs, compared to the other novels written in
Christie’s late-70s and early 80s. Her final novel,
Postern of Fate, which had editorial help, registers
a small but noticeable improvement in vocabulary,
as well as a smaller number of repetitions and
high-frequency verbs, compared to her penultimate
work, Elephants Can Remember. (Christie com-
plained about the repetitions endemic in dictating,
and possibly her illness interfered with her routine
pruning of them.) Consistent with our predictions,
we find a deficit in noun tokens that is significantly
correlated with a rise in verb and pronoun tokens;
however, when types are considered, the decline in
verbs appears to be more dramatic than in nouns.
Christie’s adverb token proportion also increases
significantly and, since it is highly correlated with
the rise in verbs, may have been a compensation for
the loss of specific, descriptive verbs.
Although Murdoch and Christie exhibit some-
what different linguistic behaviour (the latter’s dra-
matic rise in indefinite nouns is not found in
Murdoch), their common lexical decline—in con-
trast to James—validates our hypotheses with
respect to lexical markers.
5.2 Syntactic analysis
In contrast to our lexical results, little can be said
with certainty about the syntactic results, because of
the lack of significant linear trends over each entire
dataset. In particular, no significant linear trends are
found in Murdoch’s novels for the entire period, but
all syntactic measures unexpectedly reveal an abrupt
drop in her late 40s and 50s, and then a period of
recovery which, for some measures, is followed by a
slight decline in her last two novels. This early syn-
tactic drop occurs in all novels that we analyzed,
parallels a trough in her vocabulary, and so might
signify the pathology of AD, which, as mentioned
earlier, may begin many years or decades before the
disease onset (see Section 5.3 below). However, this
does not account for the gradual recovery that
followed.
As expected, James’s syntactic results follow
the patterns typical of healthy elders. Her syntactic
results vary only slightly, the widest span being
an insignificant increase in passive sentence
proportion.
Christie’s syntactic-complexity results fluctuate
in a relatively wider range. The overall trends indi-
cate a rising tendency in all measures, whereas we
had predicted declines, although only a few yield
significant results. If Christie indeed had AD
(as the lexical analysis suggests), our findings are
consistent with the observations of Bates et al.
(1995) that declines in syntax in AD occur in spe-
cific, highly constrained areas of complexity, such
as passives, and will be observed only in highly
constrained situations, such as those that present
a natural context for passive sentences. Novels
impose no such constraints. Murdoch’s and
Christie’s passive results, however, follow the same
direction that Bates et al. (1995) documented for
AD (a decrease in the passive sentence proportion,
a rise in get-passives, and a drop in be-passives),
although only Murdoch’s be-passive and Christie’s
get-passive results are significant. A result that
contradicts the expected passive patterns is
Murdoch’s proportions of passives with by-phrase,
which increase with high significance.
5.3 Murdoch’s ‘trough’
As noted, an exception to all our expectations is the
period of decline in Murdoch’s late 40s and early
50s. That dementia-induced language markers in
Murdoch’s last novel are prefigured by comparable
changes in her mid-career suggests that her AD had
a long preclinical period. Some circumstantial evi-
dence supports this. On 26 July 1970, Murdoch
wrote in her journal: ‘‘I have very little sense of
my own identity. Cd one gradually go mad by
slowly slowly losing all one’s sense of identity? I
know there is a body that moves about and some
thoughts, memories—but it’s all scattered, & now
more so’’ (Conradi, 2001, pp. 19, 654). A family
disposition may have asserted itself in 1975, when

Murdoch’s mother became demented (she died ten
years later). Murdoch had some long-term episodic
memory losses, particularly of the lovers she had in
youth (Conradi, 2001, p. 580). In 1993, she aban-
doned her book on the philosopher Heidegger in
page proofs, claiming that it was ‘‘no good’’
(Conradi, 2001, p. 586). Her unofficial biographer
observed that she deteriorated as a novelist and phil-
osopher about 1982 because of an ‘‘emotional
breakdown’’ and had always exhibited a ‘‘general
dottiness’’ (Wilson, 2003, pp. 99, 135, 232).
However, we have no explanation for her subse-
quent partial linguistic recovery prior to her final
decline.
5.4 Text analysis for early diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease
Although the scale of our study is much larger than
that of previous longitudinal studies of changes in
language in AD, we obviously cannot, from just
three subjects (one of them of uncertain diagnosis)
draw general conclusions about the feasibility of
using text analysis to facilitate the diagnosis of
AD. Indeed, the wide individual variation, seen
even in our small sample, indicates the difficulty
of the task. Nonetheless, we found sufficiently
clear trends to demonstrate that the idea has merit
and is worthy of further development.
5.5 Limitations of our analysis
The analysis that we have made is not without its
limitations. Those in data preparation may include
typographical errors in the sources or OCR errors,
incorrect determination of sentence boundaries
caused by missing or incorrect punctuation in the
data or by stylistic differences in punctuation usage,
and parse trees with either incorrect part-of-speech
tags or wrong embedding levels for linguistic com-
ponents. (However, common patterns of error in
the data were identified and corrected.) Errors
may also occur in the pattern-matching stage for
the D-Level and the passive-voice measures. The
pattern sets are not comprehensive, since several
kinds of sentence structures cannot be distinguished
from others by syntax alone. We excluded highly
ambiguous structures from the pattern sets to
avoid creating false positives, at the cost of allowing
some false negatives. Nonetheless, the defined pat-
terns may also match a relatively small number of
false positives.
6 Conclusion
We have presented a large-scale longitudinal study
of changes in language in AD using complete, fully
parsed texts and a large number of measures, avoid-
ing the limitations and deficiencies of Garrard
et al.’s (2005) study of Iris Murdoch. We were there-
by able to observe trends, such as Murdoch’s
‘trough’, that they could not. Our results support
our hypothesis that signs of dementia can be found
in diachronic analyses of patients’ writings, and in
addition lead to new understanding of the work of
the individual authors whom we studied. A major
loss in vocabulary (revealed by type/token ratio and
word-type introduction rate), an increase in repeti-
tion of fixed phrases and of content words within
close distance, a deficit in noun tokens and a com-
pensation in verb tokens, and a pronounced in-
crease in fillers demonstrate a strong linguistic
decline in both Murdoch’s and Christie’s later
works. In contrast, our measures showed no such
decline in the language of P.D. James, who is known
to have remained healthy. A disease-related linguis-
tic decline is thus clearly distinguished from the
effects of healthy aging, as hypothesized. Low-
specificity nouns and verbs, however, behave con-
trary to expectation: a decreasing (non-AD) trend in
both Murdoch and James, and an increase in
Christie. Also contrary to our hypotheses, both
Christie’s and James’s syntactic complexity results
exhibit a slight rising tendency (also non-AD),
although few measures discover a significant
trend. Passivization by Murdoch (a decrease in
be-passives) and Christie (an increase in get-
passives) resembles patterns observed in AD
patients by Bates et al. (1995), but most results
lack statistical significance. However, the syntactic
results can be interpreted as evidence that, in AD
patients, syntax resists change longer than lexis,
as expected.

In future work in this project, we plan first
to develop additional measures for comparison,
including better measures of word specificity and a
repetitiveness index that factors in phrase length,
and to look at other aspects of syntactic complexity
such as gapping and conjunction, which are reduced
in AD (Bates et al., 1995). We will also look at
semantic indicators,5 and in particular, we aim to
develop and apply measures of semantic coherence.
Also, we are adding new authors to our corpus,
including Enid Blyton and Ross Macdonald
(pseudonym of Kenneth Millar), both of whom
were diagnosed with AD, and additional control au-
thors. To develop this work for clinical use, how-
ever, we must demonstrate that the effects of AD
can be seen not just in literary text but in ordinary
functional daily writing (office memoranda, letters,
etc), and it will be necessary to identify current AD
patients (and matched controls) with sufficient
pre-diagnosis text archives to be used in such a
test. For future generations, who are already build-
ing a lifetime archive of electronic communications,
the availability of past text for eventual diagnosis
will not be a problem, though it may be necessary
to adapt the measures to the linguistic characteris-
tics of the communication media.
