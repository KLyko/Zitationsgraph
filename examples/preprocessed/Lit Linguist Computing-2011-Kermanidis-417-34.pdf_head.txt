Abstract
Paraphrasing is very useful for many applications that normally involve deep
linguistic alterations of a sentence, like summarization, textual entailment and
question answering, and usually require sophisticated external resources,
pre-processing, and semantic thesauri. This article presents a methodology for
generating shallow linguistic alterations of Modern Greek sentences making use
of only a low-resource chunker and taking advantage of the freedom in phrase
ordering of the language. A statistical significance testing process is applied for
extracting ‘swappable’ phrase bigrams. A supervised filtering phase follows, which
helps to remove erroneous paraphrasing schemata, taking into account the con-
text in which the alteration is to take place. Unlike most previous approaches to
paraphrasing, the proposed process is knowledge-poor (and thus quite easily
portable to other languages with a syntactic structure similar to Modern
Greek), robust (applicable to any type of text), domain independent, and leads
to the generation of a significant number of paraphrases, by allowing the appli-
cation of more than one syntactic alterations per sentence. The significance of the
automatically generated paraphrases is shown by their application in hiding
secret information underneath a cover text in a steganographic communication
channel. For this purpose, they need not be sophisticated linguistic alterations,
but grammatically correct and significant in number, to ensure security. A ste-
ganographic security and capacity analysis of the presented implementation, as
well as an explanatory description of the trade-off between them, is included to
show the usefulness and the practical value of the methodology.
