Abstract
At the time Darwin first published the Origin of Species, the word ‘evolution’ was
used by most biologists of the time to refer not only to specific development, as is
the case today, but also to embryological development. Darwin’s own stance in
that matter is however open to debate, his rare use of the word making it hard to
determine whether it is strictly specific or dual, and thus whether the author’s
conception of evolution is representative or ahead of its time. While this situation
certainly stimulates philological, historical, and philosophical debates, it however
complicates any attempt to settle the matter on a strict lexical basis, thus making
standard text-mining techniques ineffective. To address this specific issue, a
computer-assisted method for ‘reading Darwin between the lines’ is here at-
tempted and described: by using an iterative concordance clustering algorithm,
this approach aims at ‘digging’ into Darwin’s concept of evolution as found in
the sixth edition of the Origin of Species, regardless of any proper designation.
In light of the results thus obtained, the concept of evolution in the sixth edition
of the Origin of Species appears closer to its modern and strictly specific inter-
pretation, inferences made to words related to embryological development being
rather rare.

Whereas Darwin is nowadays considered the foun-
der of the modern theory of evolution, he was not
the first to use this word in a biological context:
as noted a while ago by Thomas Henry Huxley in
his 1878 article on evolution published in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica, the word ‘evolution’ had
two distinct biological uses at the time the Origin of
Species was first published: first, to refer to embryo-
logical development; and second, ‘to characterize
the general belief that species have descended from
one another over time’ (Richards, 1992).
The word ‘evolution’ was first used in biology to
refer to the development of the embryo, mainly
through the formulation, promulgation, and justifi-
cation of both preformationist and epigenetical the-
ories. Through the diffusion, adoption (by E´tienne
Renaud Serres, notably), and rejection (by von Baer,
among others) of Lamarck’s ideas of transmutation
and of recapitulationism (the idea that embryologic-
al ‘evolution’ recapitulates specific ‘evolution’), the
word evolution later came to be also related to spe-
cific development: ‘by the 1830s, the word ‘evolu-
tion’ had shifted 180 degrees from its original
employment and was used to refer indifferently to
both embryological and species progression’
(Richards, 1992). This dual use of the word was

still well in effect at the time Darwin wrote his per-
ennial book: in his 1852 essay ‘The development
hypothesis’, Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) openly
supports transmutation and refers to it as the
Theory of Evolution, while pointing ‘to embryologic-
al ‘‘evolution’’ as an illustration of the ability of
organic structures to modify themselves’ (Bowler,
1975).
