Abstract
Spoken discourse is a uniquely valuable source of data in cognitive research.
A natural way of representing spoken discourse is in the form of a transcript
in standard orthography. However, since transcribing is, for neuroscientists at
any rate, no more than a means to an end, many researchers give only cursory
descriptions of the transcription process, including the assessment of agreement
between transcribers. This article introduces a novel approach to the systematic
assessment of agreement between transcripts. The method first involves the auto-
mated alignment of two texts, followed by the automatic identification and
quantification of discrepancies. A similarity score is then computed, providing
researchers with a tool to evaluate the accuracy of the pair of transcripts in
question. Most importantly, the automated production of a set of comparison
tables reveals and summarizes the actual mismatches found, making it possible to
identify common causes of discrepancy. Through applying this approach to
medical data collected for an investigation of dementia, the present study dem-
onstrates its value in the amendment of transcripts and the improvement of
transcription practices, which pave the way towards more reliable transcriptions
for research purposes.
