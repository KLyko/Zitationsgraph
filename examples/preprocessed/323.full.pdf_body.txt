The trouble with computers is that their unpar-
alleled number-crunching abilities tend to encou-
rage the belief that accurate simulation is
primarily a matter of adding more and more para-
meters and increasingly detailed data (Grigsby et al.,
2003; Lead Pursuit, 2005). Manual simulation
designers, in contrast, must perforce focus on iden-
tifying and modelling only the really significant
dynamics in that particular conflict, since their
games would otherwise be completely unplayable.
In a humanities field such as war studies, these
key dynamics are often human rather than techni-
cal, and so are precisely the aspects which modellers
find it hardest to quantify (Sabin, 2007). Manual
wargame designers are used to having to settle for
an output-based, top-down design approach which
gives only an impressionistic flavour of the overall
observed reality, whereas computers seem to offer
the enticing possibility of more input-based,
bottom-up techniques in which the individual com-
ponents of a situation can be modelled in such
detail that outcomes emerge objectively from first
principles rather than through mere subjective
depiction of real experience. Not only does this
Holy Grail of ‘scientific’ objectivity tend to encou-
rage unwieldy levels of detail and complexity, as in
the ongoing agent-based modelling of Byzantine
logistics which can only be run using distributed
simulation across a network of computers (Haldon
et al., 2010), but it also tends to focus the modelling
on quantifiable technicalities at the expense of the
often more significant human element.
Modern first person computer simulations of
infantry combat or aerial dogfights illustrate the
potential problems very well. Despite highly precise
and detailed modelling of equipment characteristics,
weapons effects, and terrain, such computer simula-
tions consistently tend to produce grossly ahistorical
mutual casualty rates, because the individual com-
batants (whether controlled by AI or by real humans
at networked terminals) behave far more boldly
than they would if the bullets were real. Well over
half the computer ‘sorties’ which my students play
to get a feel for how air combat dynamics changed
over time end with them being shot down in flames.
Manual simulations find it much easier to model
the suppressive effect of fire, by simply prohibiting
users from moving or firing with troops who are
pinned down in this way (Barker, 1988; Sabin
2011, ch. 11). Since it is very common indeed for
conflicts to be affected at least as much by such
psychological dynamics as by more calculable phy-
sical parameters, manual simulations can often
identify and capture the ‘big picture’ at least as
effectively as do more detailed and visually striking
computer models (Sabin, 2007). Willard McCarty
put it very well when he wrote that, ‘a model
is by nature a simplified and therefore fictional or
idealized representation, often taking quite a rough-
and-ready form: hence the term ‘‘tinker toy’’ model
from physics, accurately suggesting play, relative
crudity, and heuristic purpose’ (McCarty, 2004,
p. 255).
A further key consideration is that ‘accessibility’
in the simulation field is a complex and double-
edged concept. Computer simulations tend to be
more accessible to users, but harder to programme
and design, so they are best suited to expert-led
situations in which a few highly capable individuals
devote considerable effort to creating a model which
can be learnt and used ‘as is’ by masses of less-qua-
lified people. Manual simulations, in contrast, tend
to be less accessible to users because they need to
master lengthy rules to be able to operate the model
at all, but in the process the users are required
to engage much more directly with the designer’s
ideas and assumptions, and it is a short step from
being able to play a manual simulation to being
able to tweak the rules or even to design entirely
new systems to give a better reflection of one’s
own understanding of the underlying military rea-
lity (Dunnigan, 1992; Sabin, 2011). Hence, manual
simulations are much more accessible from a design
perspective, since one does not need to be a com-
puter programmer to create new systems, and since
using other people’s systems conveys a much better
understanding of design techniques. The manual
simulation system in my last book prompted flour-
ishing online discussions which now amount to
well over twice as many words as there are in the
book itself (Sabin, 2007).7
Many recent computer simulations have sought
to soften their expert-led character by incorporating
provision for simple modification and scenario

generation by users themselves (Koger, 2006).
However, this flexibility rarely extends to changing
the fundamental systems, and it is actually manual
simulation design which has become radically more
accessible and democratized in the computer age,
thanks to the ease with which individuals can
now design full colour maps and counters and
sell or give away digital copies of their rules and
graphics online without any physical production
or distribution costs.8 Since I believe that designing
simulations for oneself is a far better way of gaining
insight into the dynamics of a real conflict than is
simply playing someone else’s computer game on
that subject, I see the much greater design accessi-
bility of manual simulations as a major reason for
their continued production and relevance, with
computer graphics and online distribution playing
a key role, but without the rules themselves having
to be coded into computer software.
For educational purposes, it is vital to have
design flexibility and not to be limited to commer-
cial products, because published manual and com-
puter wargames alike are generally far too complex
and lengthy to be used by students in a class context
(Garris et al., 2002; Crookall and Thorngate, 2009).
Niall Ferguson has advocated the use of commercial
computer games for history teaching,9 but I have
found specifically tailored manual designs to be
equally effective, and grouping students around
tables with large-scale physical maps and counters
works at least as well as using data projectors or
multiple monitors (Hays, 2005). I now run nine
different manual wargames per year across my
various classes, on topics ranging from the Second
Punic War to the Eastern Front in World War Two,
and all using simple games which I have designed
myself for this purpose (Salen and Zimmerman,
2004; Sabin, 2011). As I write these words, I am
preparing later today to run three simultaneous
refights of the battle of the Korsun Pocket in 1944
with my thirty BA students. Neither I nor my
MA students would be remotely capable of generat-
ing such designs in a fully computerized format,
so the manual approach offers key benefits by
making simulation design directly accessible to
those in the humanities and social sciences
(Moizer et al., 2009).
The central message of this article is that ‘simula-
tion’ and even ‘digitization’ are not necessarily
synonymous with ‘computerization’, as so many
today seem to believe. Military professionals
and enthusiasts have been producing ‘digitized’
mathematical models of conflict since long before
the computer age, and such manual simulations
continue to survive alongside their computerized
counterparts. The biggest challenge they face is
that computer simulations now have much greater
mass market appeal and a much more professional
image within defence and academia. However,
without the broad design accessibility and top-
down focus of manual simulation design, compu-
terized conflict simulation risks becoming an
unduly arcane and detail-obsessed science. I have
even been commissioned to run a full day of
manual wargames for senior British officers this
May, so as to develop their ability to design and
run such simple tailored simulations for themselves
for training and planning purposes. Manual and
computer simulations of conflict will hence
remain complementary endeavours for many years
to come.
So what does all this mean for scholars of digital
humanities? I think the key implication is the need
for balance. Computers are just one tool (albeit
a tremendously powerful one) with which the over-
all methodologies of modelling and simulation
may be pursued. Their number-crunching and
visualization capabilities are unparalleled, but soft-
ware design often appears intimidating and inacces-
sible to non-programmers, who may therefore
eschew ideas of modelling altogether and take
refuge in the traditional qualitative and verbally
based methodologies of humanities teaching and
research. Manual modelling offers a potentially
valuable bridge, which can allow humanities
academics to develop their own modelling
concepts while also weaning programmers and
non-programmers alike away from the double-
edged temptation to seek progress through ever
more complex and comprehensive data inputs. It
provides a lingua franca which all parties (with a
little effort) should be able to comprehend fully,
rather than just take on trust. By helping to foster
truly collaborative rather than merely mutually

dependent intellectual relationships, manual model-
ling may pave the way for more widespread and
routine integration of computing capabilities into
humanities teaching and research, thereby yielding
the best of both worlds.
