Abstract
This article investigates the issues to be faced while producing a digital edition of
a representative medieval text: Statuta Comunis Vicentie (1264). Statuta comunis
are collections of civic rules very common in Northern Italy since the twelfth
century. We are dealing specifically with the ones of Vicenza, a town near Venice.
Statuta were usually organized in a single or multiple codices, including the col-
lection of the civic rules, matched and allotted in big chapters (libri) according to
the subject. Another fundamental characteristic is the constant review of the
original text in different periods, generally due to changes in the government
or in the organization of the city. Therefore, the most relevant matters to deal
with are: first, description of metadata; second, structural analysis of the text;
third, the markup of the additions and amendments; and fourth; identification of
specific semantic values, in particular personal names, organizational names and
names of places. This article outlines the reasons for choosing XML/TEI for the
project, how to address the four matters listed above and how the chosen stan-
dard can be customized to treat the peculiar aspects of this text according to the
traditional editing practice.

1 Introduction
This article illustrates the initial results of the digital
edition project within the wider research program
named Le fonti normative nell’Italia del basso med-
ioevo.1 Many universities participated in it, thus
enabling a rich exchange of perspectives highlight-
ing different regional realities. 2 Through compari-
sons and on the basis of disciplinary traditions the
project goal was to develop a common framework
for the creation of digital editions of normative
medieval sources.
2 Source Features
The statute is one of the main documents of the
communal age in Italy. Usually, it consists of a
handwritten codex which collects the laws that a
‘comune’ laid down in different ways
(Cammarosano, 1998, Ch. 2.4). A single law could
be indicated as capitulum, rubrica, or statutum,
causing the entire codification to be named after
the plural: statuta. The statuta were usually divided
into different subjects (de civilibus, de crim-
inalibusð) named libri. To make it easier to find

information in them, there was a rubricarium––i.e. a
list of all the books (libri)––and the correspondent
capitula within the text.
These codices were often of fine workmanship
which emphasized the solemnity of their content.
However their main characteristic lays in their
being constantly revised and updated over time,
thus making it possible to consider them a sort of
‘stratigraphy’ (Caprioli, 1981, 1988, 1989). Usually
there are no indications regarding the specific date
when the additions or modifications were made and
several different critical evaluations are necessary to
approximately state their chronology. A first initial
body of the oldest laws can be identified by their
reference to the consules, a collegial magistrature
that governed the ‘comune’ in the twelfth century
before the predominance of the foreign ‘podesta`’
(i.e. a ruler chosen from outside the municipality)
in the thirteenth century. In addition, the oldest
laws were usually written using first person pro-
nouns, recalling the original breve or oath that the
magistrates were obliged to swear. The subjective
form was gradually, but noticeably, substituted by
an objective declaration, which stands as a typical
act of a communal entity or the direct emanation of
a law.
The genesis of the statuta might be straightfor-
ward or quite complex depending on the various
political/urban events on the one hand, and the dif-
ferent manuscript traditions on the other. In this
heterogeneous context, the Statuta comunis
Vicentie of 1264 stand out as an example of great
interest. Even in its various stratifications, the text is
well structured and all its parts can be visibly iden-
tified making it suitable for a digital edition. The
edition analysed here is based on manuscript 564,
preserved by the Biblioteca Civica Bertoliana in
Vicenza. It is a codex optimus: the unique surviving
copy of the text of the Statuta of the thirteenth
century. It is in a precarious state of preservation,
mainly because many sheets have been trimmed and
the ink has vanished in many places. There is only
one print edition of this codex made in 1886 by
Fedele Lampertico. In this edition, Lampertico pub-
lished the Statuta of 1264 (re-edited for this digital
edition) together with the Banna et ordinamenta of
the ‘comune’ of Vicenza dated 1275, even though
from a codicological point of view they are evidently
distinguished within the manuscript. 3 The Statuta
comunis Vicentie were compiled during the govern-
ment of the ‘podesta`’ Rolando de Englesco in 1264.
They form the greatest part of the codex (cc. 1–88)
and are divided into four books with a preface
which lists all the viros nobiles, providos, et discretos
that together compiled the Statuta (Cracco, 1988).
The first book is dedicated to the sacramenta of
the main authorities of the ‘comune’, the second
to the civil ruling exclusively governed by the
‘podesta`’ or by his judges or by his consules, the
third to penal justice. The fourth book together
with the first is quite rich. The first part of this
book is dedicated to the laws in force regarding
the various professions and the organization of the
urban spaces, while its last pages describe the rela-
tionships between Vicenza and the surrounding
cities.
The books are coherently organized in separate
rubricae introduced by a title, with chapters clearly
distinguished by paragraph indicators. The text is
composed in littera textualis by a single hand,
named ‘mano1’ (that is ‘hand 1’), with additions
of three other hands:
 A hand named ‘manoA’ writes in littera textualis
making additions and substitutions. The same
‘manoA’ probably composed the ‘Statuti
Interpolati’ (cc. 88v–89r). This section has been
named this way in the nineteenth century edition
of the Statuta (Lampertico, 1886, p. LVII).
Considering the reference in the text to dominus
Guidonis de Nigro (c. 88v) as the ‘podesta`’ of
the ‘comune’ of Vicenza, this scribe most
likely worked after 1265 (Cracco, 1988, p. 121),
and not beyond the beginning of the four-
teenth century as suggested by palaeographical
analysis.
 A cursive hand that can be dated between the end
of the thirteenth or the beginning of the four-
teenth, named ‘manoB’, generally comments and
provides glosses in the rubricae of 1264, some-
times only defining a title.
 A cursive hand, named ‘manoC’, rarely writes
and is datable on palaeographical basis to the
end of the sixteenth century.

3 How to Choose a Standard
Considering the manuscript features, structural
issues and text stratification, the best solution for
a digital edition of the Statuta appeared to be
XML (eXtensible Markup Language). But the ques-
tion remained, which are the best encoding solu-
tions that can be used for a source of this kind
inside the world of XML: whether to adhere to a
standard or to create an independent system.
Within the Italian context, especially in diplomatics
and historical science, the general trend of adhering
to standards is not followed as much as it is in other
countries. This is not only due to a certain cultural
particularism, but also for specific historical reasons.
The most relevant digital encoding standard of the
mid-1990s in the field of humanities was certainly
the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), 4 whose first
versions were expressed in SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).5 The first estab-
lished version called P1, was released in 1990s.
This was followed by P2 (April 1993), while the
first P3 was released in 1994; but the final revision
of P3 (called P4 beta) was made available in May
1999. 6 It was a long process. In 1999 Michele
Ansani, introducing the project of the CDLM
(Codice Diplomatico della Lombardia Medievale), 7
described in an article what the TEI model meant at
that time: ‘a complex system of rules enabled to
normalize and unify the practice of representing tex-
tual phenomenona in electronic format’. After out-
lining the trend of TEI towards the codification of
literary texts, Ansani continued with his reflections:
‘The guidelines of a standard encoding system for
every kind of text will always be, in this perspective,
inadequate and unsatisfactory for somebody (or
many). [ð] Therefore, we will need to find diversi-
fied and more specific solutions.’ (Our translation,
Ansani, 2000) These considerations lead to the
necessity and the consequent development of an
independent encoding system able to manage––on
a diplomatic analysis level––the complexity of the
medieval Lombardy parchments.
This was a reasonable choice considering what
TEI was in 1999. The burden of SGML on the initial
versions of TEI was heavy considering that the first
XML 1.0 Recommendations were published in 1998,
and the second version 1.1 on the 6 October 2000. 8
Moreover, P2 still employed SGML parsers, and
using DTDs were the only option to constrain
encoding (the customization of which was a partic-
ularly difficult procedure). 9 It was clear right from
the beginning that to make the complex DTD sus-
tainable it had to be modular, and to this purpose,
the TEI adopted the so called ODD system (One
Document Does it All). This system had the great
advantage of distributing the DTD code in separate
modules which were recalled when needed by the
main DTD. For a non-skilled user, the entire DTD
appeared as a mass of files identified by a variety of
names and extensions (.dtd and .ent) for each group
of entities without having a simple and intuitive
means to manage the entire thing (Burnard and
Rahtz, 2004). The first version of P3 had the same
problems and the digital humanists who used the
TEI in the 1990s had to deal with it, if only to
decide, as Ansani did, that it was not suitable for
them.
At that time TEI was difficult to work with for
normative and documentary medieval sources, not
only because it had been conceived for literary anal-
ysis, but also due to the difficulty in extending it and
mastering its modularity. For these reasons Michele
Ansani chose to give the priority to diplomatics and
developed an independent encoding system
(Ansani, 2002, 2006). The effort to establish a
strong ecdotic in the ‘digital arena’ produced a
DTD far more flexible than TEI and with a totally
mixed content model, many elements and a smaller
number of attributes. 10
The CDLM project was a great success: the
number of edited documents grew over time and
new editions of historical collections are being
produced. Another great feature of CDLM is that
HTML is not the only output, but the whole XML
code is totally accessible and highly documented.
Therefore, gradually, the DTD of the CDLM
became for the Italian context a standard to look
to for its qualities, ease of availability, accessibility of
code, and extensive documentation in Italian.
In light of the positive results, many medievalists
edited different kinds of documents using the DTD
developed for the CDLM or, very often, a custom-
ized version of it with the flexibility to go beyond

the structure of the typical Lombard notarial docu-
ment and to revise the order of the textual
elements.11
A meeting held in Verona in December 2005 on
literary text and documentary editions demon-
strated that even today the majority of Italian
solutions for medieval sources are based on
CDLM.12 For example, during this meeting,
Lorenzo Tanzini (University of Florence research
group) illustrated a special version of this DTD in
which the elements corresponded to the main parts
of the regulatory text (incipit, explicit, invocatio,
proemium, publicatio, liber, rubrica, capitulum, addi-
tiones, reformationes, clausulae, etc.), while we pro-
posed a reconsideration of the suitability of TEI for
this purpose.
An initial experimental markup of the statute
with TEI Lite (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen,
2005) and the subsequent introduction of new ele-
ments dealing with various encoding issues lead us
to consider the P5 version of the Guidelines. From
that moment, we considered the possibility of
employing P5 for an edition of medieval sources.
Two innovations were crucial to this change in
our perspective: the first concerns available tools.
Originally the ODD architecture of TEI was mana-
ged by an online tool named the ‘Pizza Chef’. 13 The
critical approach was correct, but the online tool
was inadequate to manage the modular system.
Moreover, its graphical interface, claiming to be as
attractive as its name, had the opposite effect for the
community of Italian palaeographers and medieval-
ists. Today the tool is Roma, whose functionality,
based on new and more effective languages to
describe the documents, facilitates much better
modular management. 14
The interface clearly divides the work in different
steps, and it is possible to select only those
elements needed (grouped in customizable classes)
as well as to add new attributes or elements as
necessary. With Roma, the most important thing
is that each work session can be saved in a single
XML file. Once the desired result is achieved it is
possible to generate automatically and in different
formats not only the DTD, but also all the docu-
mentation featuring the analytical description of
each element.
The second innovation lays in the fact that TEI
has become an open source project. Even if TEI
always claimed to be open to the contributions of
the international scientific community, for many
years it seemed to be ‘centralized and managed by
a restricted group of researchers’ (Burnard and
Sperberg-McQueen, 2005, p. 211). For this reason
the great innovation of the open source project with
a free software repository hosted on Sourceforge
must be congratulated. 15
Considering these two innovative aspects, TEI
can be employed both by scholars more bound to
traditional methods and lexicon, and by those who
need to investigate more specific issues relating to
these primary sources. For example, during the
above mentioned conference in Verona, Lorenzo
Tanzini suggested that an element <dispositio>,16
already included in the CDLM DTD, could be
used to mark the initial part of the rubrica. But a
similar result can still be achieved in TEI by using
the <div> element to define the text segment and
qualifying it with a type attribute (and, if necessary,
with a subtype). Instead of <dispositio contenu-
to¼‘‘ufficio’’> we can therefore encode it with
<div type¼‘‘dispositio’’ subtype¼‘‘ufficio’’>.
If a scholar does not agree with this solution,
there are alternatives. It would be possible to
choose Italian and Latin tags using a vocabulary
common to the discipline creating an XSLT that
automatically translates the elements into TEI,
becoming a data exportation format. This compli-
cation can be easily avoided in TEI P5 by integrating
new elements in a simple and documented manner.
For example, we tested and determined that the ele-
ment <dispositio type¼‘‘ufficio’’> can easily be
added in a P5 created with Roma for the Statuta
encoding. Considering all these opportunities and
the possibility of adding new elements to TEI
during the execution of the work, we opted for
TEI P5.
4 Encoding
All that was left was for us to determine if and then
how the TEI satisfied the following four essential
needs: (1) description of the digital resource and

the manuscript with adequate metadata; (2) struc-
tural analysis of the text; (3) visualization of addi-
tions; and (4) semantic analysis.
4.1 Metadata
Metadata represents the ‘electronic title page’ of our
digital edition, and it is defined in the TeiHeader.
From this point of view, the P5 version offers sub-
stantial improvement as it separates the descriptive
form of the digital resource from that of the manu-
script. With reference to the digital resource
description, we simply used <fileDesc> and the cor-
responding nested items.
Regarding the manuscript description, we gave
great importance to <sourceDesc>. Within this
item we referred to the first printed edition with
<biblFull> (fully structured bibliographic citation),
while with <msDescription> we described the
Statuta comunis Vicentie and the ms. 564 preserved
in the Bertoliana library, giving a precise codicolog-
ical description.
All the detailed information on the manuscript is
described within specific elements.17 For the physi-
cal description of the manuscript we split
<physDesc> into several elements: <objectDesc>
which contains <supportDesc> (support descrip-
tion) for the type of written material, number and
dimensions of the manuscript’s folia with the cor-
responding protective leaf, the different foliation
and its state of preservation; and <layoutDesc>
(layout description) which describes the mise-en-
page of the folia and the kind of ink used. Finally
we used <handDesc> (hand description), to indi-
cate the different hands operating on the codex,
<decoDesc> (decoration description) and <addi-
tions>, to refer to other formal aspects such as the
presence of flourished initials or little hands or wavy
lines at the text margin and <bindingDesc> to
describe the cover.
4.2 Structure
This level of encoding represents the formal divi-
sions of the text. The root element is <text>,
which comprises: <front>, used to outline the pro-
logue of the statute and <body>, with the full text
body of the Statuta comunis Vicentie of 1264.
Inside <body> lays the actual text structure
which is quite clear, allowing the easy naming of
elements which were specified by adding different
values to attributes. We have typed the <div> ele-
ments respectively with the values libro, rubrica and
capitolo. In this way, we created a far more flexible
structure than by using numbered divisions (div0,
div1ð).18 This is a clear example of how markup
focused on attributes combined with elements is
generally more flexible. Moreover, the attribute
values have been chosen for practical purposes.
We used English for standard values and several
indications in Italian to specify the partition, the
page, and positions in the text.

The titles, usually written in red ink (therefore
called in Latin rubricati), are marked with the
element <head>; the line break has been marked
by the empty tag <lb/> (line break), while the ele-
ment <milestone>, which includes the number of
the carta and the values ‘‘carta_recto’’ or ‘‘carta_
verso’’, was used to indicate the page that follows.
Another element used to structure the text body is
<list>, which allows highlighting the sequence of
different items, each of them within the tag
<item>, which in the Statuta comunis Vicentie are
normally introduced by a special red para-sign, very
common in this kind of sources, called ‘pie` di
mosca’.
4.3 Additions and integrations
This markup level shows contemporary or later var-
iations to the 1264 text. The element <add> (addi-
tion) indicates the presence of signs of correction or
additions to the text body. The attribute @hand,
with the values: ‘‘mano1’’, ‘‘manoA’’, ‘‘manoB’’,
and ‘‘manoC’’, indicates the hand that worked on
the manuscript and made the integration or mod-
ification. Further attributes show the precise posi-
tion of the addition (place¼‘‘sopralinea_
continuando’’19 or ‘‘intralinea_continuando’’20)
and if any special type of sign of addition was
used (rend¼‘‘segno_inserzione’’21).
To indicate that some parts were deleted we used
the tag <del> (deletion) with the attribute @hand to
refer to the hand and with the attribute @type to
specify in which way the correction or modification
occurred (for example type¼‘‘depennato’’,22
‘‘espunto’’,23 ‘‘cancellato_per_lettera_sovrascritta’’,24
‘‘cancellato’’,25 ‘‘dittografato’’,26 etc.), as in the exam-
ple below:
4.4 Semantics
The fourth, and until now the last encoding level, is
dedicated to such content like antroponimies and
toponimies in order to create, upon completion of
the edition, indexes of names and places. TEI
encoding offers a wide set of indications for even
the most complex of places: the element

<placeName> is subdivided into <district>, <settle-
ment>, etc. Similarly, names are marked with
<persName>, divided into <forename>, <sur-
name>, etc.
During the Middle Ages, however, the ways
of naming people and places changed, resulting
in many ambiguities and uncertainties. The prob-
lem is that these names contain more than
one expression, and it is not easy to determine
their correct hierarchical order. For example, a cer-
tain place indicated or mentioned in a document
from the eleventh century can be composed by the
simultaneous indication of massa, fundus, locus,
plebs, vicus, etc. without a clear indication to the
reader of the territorial relationships between these
entities. 27 Sometimes the author was probably
unaware of their territorial relationships when
writing the document. Although, we have not
found an example of this in the first two books of
the Statuta encoded so far, we know that such case is
likely to occur even in texts of the thirteenth
century.
The same situation exists for names of people.
The first attempt to regularize surnames started
with many uncertainties at the end of the twelfth
century and surnames became fixed only for a small
portion of the population by the end of the thir-
teenth. A real system of regular surnames became
stable only in the sixteenth century. In addition, a
person could be indicated by a chain of patronymics
with no precise rule in regarding its order for a long
time, or a patronymic could have been an early
example of a surname.28
Therefore, it is first necessary to handle
these segments without any consideration of the
kind of classification or hierarchy: a flat markup.
People’s name are marked with the element
<persName> without using the specific nested ele-
ment and without linking the onomastic indication
to the person for this reason. Within our context,
this is possible only at the end of the edition, using
the nominative singular name, which we decided to
indicate with the attribute @regular. 29 For a per-
son’s name we also employed @type to refer to the
role or a special apposition appearing on that
occasion.
Similarly, the names of places are encoded within
the <placeName> element and inside it is nested
<settlement> to indicate the various components.
The nominative singular, suitable for further use,
is indicated within <placeName> by the attribute
@regular. For the few places of certain identification
such as Vicenza, Padua and Venice, in order to give
a first set of indications for a clear identification of
the toponimies, we add to the <placeName> the
@key attribute.
In most cases, the indication consists of two mem-
bers: one is general and the other specific. In similar
cases, <settlement> is intuitively included in the
broader toponomastic indication. If other more
complex indications should occur at the same time,
we successfully experienced the nesting or juxtaposi-
tion of <settlement> sequences. <settlement> comes
with the attributes @regular and @type, which indi-
cates the type of place (e.g. a church, a street, etc.).
The systematic use of @regular to extract the
occurrences in an alphabetical order allowed us to
mark the complete reference to a person (apposition
included) and all the complete references to places,
including meaningful prepositions, which are often
of great interest to historians. 30 It is possible to refer
to @regular values for the semiautomatic composi-
tion of lists of variants. 31

Finally, the last element used at this level is
<orgName> (organizational names), with no fur-
ther attribute, to mark institutions such as the
Church of Rome.
5 Workflow
We codified and edited the first of the four books of
the Statuta comunis Vicentie following the described
guidelines. All the results and materials of the proj-
ect are updated and available online at: http://
vicenza.statutacommunis.org.
Even if partial, these results are available for the
scientific community to view. There is still a great
amount of work that can be done to improve our
encoding. We would, however, like to emphasize
that although this edition took into consideration
the results of a national study, it was developed
looking at the wider international context.
Our practice in using Roma showed that differ-
ent traditions can be accommodated. With our
encoding system we were enable to reflect the
main structural features of the Statuta comunis
Vicentie and to manage additions and integrations.
We also experienced that with Roma further analy-
sis levels can be added.
Over the past few months we presented the
results of our project at several conferences, creating
interest as well as receiving many observations
which helped us to correct different aspects of our
encoding.32 Despite the work we still have to do,
what really matters is the possibility that our expe-
rience will re-open the debate in Italy on the use of
TEI for the digital editions of normative medieval
sources.
Encoding the first book took a long time, but
thanks to experience acquired in the process and
to suggestions and feedback provided by our colleag-
ues, we have now a stable methodology and homo-
geneous criteria for the rest of the work. Upon
completion of the encoding of the other books, we
will complete the work on semantics by sorting lists,
identifying people and places, and finally we will
produce the indexes.
The complete edition deserves a better web site
than the present one; we thus intend to implement a
special visualizing system that would enable differ-
ent types of visualizations of the text using different
XSLT and CSS style sheets based on the same XML
source, thus considering different scholarly
approaches to the Statuta comunis Vicentie.
6 Conclusions
The new theoretical and practical perspectives
embodied in P5 have been the touchstone for our
project. What is really important to us was the abil-
ity to go from an experimental phase with limited
resources to the publishing of a significant part of
the Statuta comunis Vicentie online, making the
codex and the related materials fully available to
others. We expect the entire publication to be com-
pleted within a short period of time.
The digital edition of the Statuta comunis
Vicentie of 1264 represents an attempt to synthesize
the consolidated Italian practice on this subject with
a different international approach.
We feel that we have proved the possibility of
adopting TEI version P5 for the digital edition of
statutory sources. The acknowledgement of TEI P5
as a reference standard opens the door to new edi-
tions and makes the comparison between different
experiences easier.
