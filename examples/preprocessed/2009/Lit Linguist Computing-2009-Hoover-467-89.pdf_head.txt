Abstract
The dangers of computational approaches to authorship attribution in the
absence of an adequate set of training texts for the claimant authors are well
known. This study aims to show, however, that significant progress can be made
even where conditions are quite problematic. We investigate a difficult author-
ship question involving three texts, ostensibly by three authors, each of whom
wrote nothing else. Only one of the texts can be unquestionably ascribed to a
known author, and this author has been suggested as the true author of one of
the two remaining texts. We investigate these three texts, along with similar texts
by other authors, using cluster analysis, Delta analysis, t-testing, and PCA. We
also create simulations of our authorship problem using sets of three texts of
known authorship by one, two, and three authors. We test these sets using correct
and incorrect assumptions of authorial difference, and then compare the results
with analyses of our three texts based on the same range of assumptions. By
combining information from all of these tests, we achieve what we believe is a
persuasive, if not conclusive, solution to a significant and long-standing question
concerning the authorship of Maria Wardaâ€™s violently anti-Mormon Female Life
Among the Mormons. At the same time, we demonstrate methods for making
progress in cases where conditions are less than ideal.
