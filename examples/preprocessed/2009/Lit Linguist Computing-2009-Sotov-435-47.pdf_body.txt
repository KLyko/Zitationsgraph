Abstract
This research1 evaluates the extent to which lexical diversity, measured by fre-
quent content words, hapax legomena, and type-token ratios (TTRs), is depen-
dent on three features of the genre of the oral Indo-Aryan cultic poetry
represented by the literary corpus of the Rq gveda (ca. 165,000 tokens): character-
istic choice of subject matter, usage of refrains, and the attribution of hymns to
distinct poetic collectives. Analysis of 255 texts of 200 tokens showed that hymns
on popular topics and where refrains were attested have a significantly higher rate
of high-frequency content words and a lower ratio of once-occurring types. A
higher TTR is observed in the hymns of specific family origin. Complexity of
genre can be interpreted as a result of different discourse strategies of the poets.
Overall, conservative mythological texts are characterized by regularity in word
usage. Occurrence of content words, in the entire corpus, with lexemes denoting
‘deities’ on the one side and ‘nature’ on the other is accounted for by the factor of
semantics, which deals with the structure of narrative.

1 Introduction
Addressed mostly to various deities of the Vedic
pantheon, the hymns of the Rq gveda (Rq V) were cre-
ated by ancient Indian poets and priests (kavı´-, r
_
sq i-,
brahma´n-) in the condition of orality (Ong, 1982)
during a lengthy period. They were put together as a
samq hita¯, ‘an arranged collection of texts’, in ca.
1000–600 BC (Gonda 1975, p. 15; Deshpande,
1993, p. 134; Witzel, 1997, p. 263). The central,
yet not infrequently implied rather than articulated,
topic of the hymns is cosmogony, a set of concepts
on the origin of the Universe and on the place of
human beings in it. Indo-Aryans believed in the
magical force of a skilfully pronounced word and
revered their samq hita¯s as the divine revelation (s´ru´ti-).
They entrusted the privilege of accessing their sacred
knowledge (veda-) to seers, whose prestige relied on
victories in ritualized verbal contests (Kuiper, 1960;
Thompson, 1997, p. 20). The collection of ‘praises’
(rc -) reflects the dominant, institutionalized dis-
course of the Vedic epoch (Smith, 1994). The Rq V
can be viewed as a diachronic genre-specific corpus
representing the ideology of its creators. Following
Biber (1995), ‘genre’ in this article corresponds to a
named and culturally distinguished category of texts
(p. 9), while ‘discourse’ is understood as a linguis-
tically mediated ‘technology of knowledge’
(Duranti, 1997, p. 12) in its particular historic con-
ditionality, i.e. ‘conventional ways of talking, . . .
which embody . . . social values and views of the
world’ (Stubbs, 1996, p. 158). The term ‘narrative’
is used broadly to identify the ways discourse is
habitually structured into separate texts.

In literature studies interest in the genre of the
Rq V is reflected in various approaches to the struc-
ture and style of hymns, which typically observe the
regular occurrence of certain textual features, i.e.
‘formal devices . . . all of which would help shape
the attentive listening of an audience of poetic
adepts’ (Jamison, 2004, p. 247). It is useful to dis-
tinguish aesthetic, functional and descriptive meth-
ods of analysis.
In the aesthetic approach to the genre of the
hymns style emerges as the creative mastery of fig-
ures of speech. Codified in normative poetics, they
presuppose a specific mode of perception: the
recognition and evaluation of these figures. In
Indian context, the tradition of aesthetic stylistics
is rooted in a number of treatises referred to as
alamq ka¯ras´a¯stra, theory of poetic devices
(alamq ka¯ras). Indian poetology is traced back by
some scholars to the epoch of the r
_
sq is (Kane,
1951), while others put emphasis on an inherently
receptive aspect of the Vedic poetry. It is often
argued that its ‘main purpose’ was ‘to give delight,
to both the deity addressed and the listener in gen-
eral’ (Mainkar, 1966, p. 3). This intention, along
with the belief in the power of the spoken word as
a means of attaining human goals, formed a poetical
practice to which different kinds of repetition were
central.
According to Gonda (1959), a stylistic study of
the Veda should not be limited to poetic devices. It
is necessary to establish the interrelationship
between stylistic features and the production of
texts in an archaic oral tradition. Since ‘Vedic lit-
erature, and especially the mantras, is highly formu-
laic, and increasingly conventional, in character’
(p. 155), the use of stereotypic expressions and repe-
titions in it is constructive, not simply ornamental.
Gonda’s interest in stylistic repetition laid a founda-
tion for the functional method. Elizarenkova ana-
lyses the Rq V explicitly in relation to the purpose of
the poetic message (Elizarenkova, 1995, p. 9).
Vocabulary, metrical form, ‘sound-picturing’ and
syntax are kinds of ‘supra-text’ (p. 121) employed
in a laudation as channels of transmitting informa-
tion to the addressee, a Vedic deity. The commu-
nicative factor is said to structure the texts to such a
degree of conformity that a standard hymn model is
introduced (p. 9). The formal devices, studied by
Jakobson (1960) within his theory of self-orienta-
tion of the poetical language, acquired in
Elizarenkova’s functional analysis a communicative
purpose: the hymns dealt with the situation of a gift
exchange between the r
_
sq i and the divinity
(Elizarenkova, 1995, p. 3–4; 1997, p. 49).
Similarly, Watkins (1995) treats the interrelation
of the technique and the purpose of literary creativ-
ity ‘in the Indo-European times’ in respect of the
function of the Indo-European poet, ‘the custodian
and the transmitter’ of the tradition (p. 68).
. . . [T]he art of the Indo-European poet is to
say something wholly traditional in a new and
interesting, but therefore more effective way.
It is verbal activity . . . directed toward
a . . . concrete goal . . . [F]ormulas are the vehi-
cles of themes and . . . in the totality of these
we find the doctrine, ideology, and culture of
the Indo-Europeans.
Watkins maintains an indiscriminate view of sty-
listics and poetics, referring by it to ‘all the linguistic
devices which in Jakobson’s phrase are ‘‘what makes
a verbal message a work of art’’ ’(p. 21). Elizarenkova
and Watkins understand poetics as a system of tex-
tual features and presuppose the Saussurian dicho-
tomy of langue and parole (cf. Elizarenkova, 1995,
p. 2 ff) between the reconstructed poetics and its
specific, individual realization in hymns, which are
viewed as the functional whole.
Unlike the functional method, the descriptive
approach is aimed at the analysis of linguistic fea-
tures irrespective of their purpose. Bloomfield et al.
(1934) describe flexion of nouns, pronouns, and
adjectives in recurring mantras in terms of formal,
syntactic, and, notably, stylistic variants. The latter
is an a posteriori category; it includes variants,
defined as follows (p. 20).
. . . [They] have no real relation to the syntac-
tic uses of the variant morphemes,
but . . . [their] interest consists in the light
they throw on the process of Vedic tradition.
They illuminate the ways in which the whole
stock of mantra material was reworked in the
course of centuries, but do not illustrate
points of Vedic grammar.

‘Based entirely upon linguistic and stylistic evi-
dence’ (Fosse, 1997, p. 42), a study by Wu¨st (1928)
follows the descriptive method, although it deals
primarily with the internal chronology of the
hymns rather than their genre and structure.
Quantitative data collected by Wu¨st is descriptive:
the distribution of countable formal features in the
books of the Rq V is an important empirical charac-
teristic of the corpus. Yet it is meaningless without a
sound category of comparison, whereas his factor of
‘stylistic history’ leads astray (Gonda, 1959, p. 12).
The quest for the internal chronology of the corpus
might altogether be a folly when it comes to estab-
lishing a cause of linguistic variation, for, indeed, ‘it
has long been recognised that a time difference that
correlates with linguistic differences does not in
itself explain the linguistic difference’ (Jucker,
1992, p. 24).
Aesthetic, functional, and descriptive methods of
analysis differ as much as the researchers’ objectives
are different. On the one side is the investigation of
the figures of speech and the reconstruction of the
‘mytho-poetic model of the universe’, as Toporov
would put it (1992, p. 161), of which the Rq V ‘pre-
sents one variant’ (Elizarenkova, 1995, p. 10); on the
other is the description of textual regularities which
‘do not illustrate points of Vedic grammar’
(Bloomfield et al., 1934, p. 20) or allegedly deal
with language change (Wu¨st, 1928). Criteria for
selecting features for analysis are also different. An
a priori knowledge of poetic devices, alamq ka¯ras, may
or may not be required for a stylistic investigation of
genre from the aesthetic perspective. In the latter
instance an empirical criterion of poeticity is the
repetition of linguistic features. Functional analysis
on the ground of Jakobsonian linguistic poetics
empirically relies on repetitions (phonetic, syntacti-
cal, or lexical), although an a priori non-linguistic
factor is presupposed. The genre of cultic poetry, its
communicative nature or the ‘grammar of poetics’
are categories that cover the entire samq hita¯, not
really its parts. In contrast, extensive registers in
Bloomfield et al. (1934) give an idea of stylistic
variation in similar contexts after ‘purely gramma-
tical’ instances are exhausted, but the question of
factors that influenced the diversity is not explicitly
raised.
However, the method of corpus-based lexical
description is well established in Vedology, a disci-
pline relying almost exclusively on collections of
fixed texts. It is consistently employed in the monu-
mental dictionary of Grassman ([1873] 1964), and
in the concordances of Bloomfield (1906) and
Lubotsky (1997). Corpus approach to lexical analy-
sis suggests the possibility of an empirical study of
the Vedic lexis (and semantics) in relation to the
genre of the corpus and the regularity of discourse
it presumably carried. This agenda is encouraged by
the tradition of quantitative analysis in Indology
(Fosse, 1997). Various attempts in the fields of
corpus semantics and discourse analysis emphasize
the importance of genre studies, especially with
regard to ideology, rhetoric, style, and poetics
(Stubbs, 1996, 2001; Biber and Conrad, 2001),
while lexical representation of social discourse
attracts the persistent attention of linguistic anthro-
pologists (Duranti, 1997). This makes the task
of describing lexis in a speech event specific,
socially constructed collection of texts particularly
relevant.
2 Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this article is to provide empirical
evidence of patterns of word usage in the Rq V
in support of the thesis of the complexity and het-
erogeneity of its genre. The research questions
are as follows: (1) is there a dependency between
lexical diversity and a typology of hymns? (2)
Do key concepts of mythology relate to each other
in a regular and consistent manner in transmitting
the subject matter of the hymns? Both questions
are viewed in the present research as a part of the
problem of how lexical choice by the Vedic rhap-
sodes was influenced by their conventions and
ideology.

study: the linguistic analysis of padapa¯tq ha, the mod-
ification of the continuous text (samq hita¯) which
split it up into constituent word forms, and the
anukramanq ı¯ indexes. Since the type-token distinc-
tion is critical for a corpus study, only padapa¯tq ha
texts, as they appear in the computer-readable data-
base of the S´a¯kala S´a¯kha¯ Rq V (Gippert, 2000), were
taken into account.2 An occurrence of a specific
word-string in the word frequency list of the
corpus is hereafter understood as the word ‘type’,
while ‘token’ refers to its instance in a particular
padapa¯tq ha context. According to the word fre-
quency list of the Rq V, compiled automatically with
the help of concordance software, the collection of
hymns (N¼ 1028) counts 164,757 tokens and
29,199 types. The mean length of text is 160.3
tokens. Rare and frequent type lists were taken
from the word frequency list in order to measure
lexical diversity as will be clarified in the next sec-
tion. Word frequency list, collocations, and word
clusters were extracted from the entire corpus,
while the analyses of lexical diversity were based
on a sample of 255 texts.
The anukramanq ı¯ indexes identify deities, poetic
meters, number of verses, and the names of
the poets for hymns and their parts (Gonda, 1975,
p. 34 ff). The Sarva¯nukramanq ı¯ is based on
anterior indexes, ‘embodying the substance of all
of them’ (MacDonell, 1886, p. VIII), and contains
this information for every hymn of the available
recension, the S´a¯kala S´a¯kha¯ Rq V. The emergence of
the indexes is attributed to the codification of
hymns in a canon; although authorship state-
ments in Sarva¯nukramanq ı¯ are considered ‘quasi-
historical’ (Bloomfield, 1916, p. 634), its
definition of the hymns’ subject-matter is used in
this study as early evidence of their perception
within the tradition. It has been noticed that the
anukramanq ı¯ characteristics partly correspond to
the arrangement of hymns in the recension
(Witzel, 1997, p. 261; Bryant, 2001, p. 66). This is
especially true for the so-called family books
(manq dq alas 2–7), the exclusive collections of certain
priestly clans, which are viewed by scholars,
following Oldenberg (1888), as the core (Gonda,
1975, p. 9).
3.2 Data analysis
Lexical diversity was described as three variables
[type-token ratio (TTR), frequent content words
ratio (FCWR), hapax ratio (HR)] which were com-
pared with three categorical factors: attestation of
repeated word clusters, position of a hymn in the
collection, and its topic (C1, C2, C3). Since the
measures are sensitive to the lengths of texts, they
were calculated for each hymn on the basis of the
first 200 tokens only. Shorter hymns were excluded.
The TTR is the ‘average number of tokens per
types’ (Baker, 2006, p. 52):
TTR ¼ Number of types  100%
Total number of tokens
ð1Þ
It shows how inclined the authors of the hymns
were to repeat the same words in their poetry.
Generally, the higher the TTR, the more varied is
the verbal repertoire. Lower TTR may indicate ‘a
high degree or repetition and reduced complexity
of a text’ (Scharl, 2004, p. 28), as well as the use
of ‘standardised terminology’ (p. 29).
The FCWR is the percentage of frequent content
word tokens:
FCWR¼Number of frequent content tokens100%
Total number of tokens
ð2Þ
Frequent types, i.e. words attested one hundred
and more times in the corpus, occurring twice as
often than any others in each hymn, correspond to
0.5% of the word frequency list of the Rq V. Lexemes
which contributed to the largest number of frequent
types are function words, verbs of motion and exis-
tence, names of the deities (ı´ndra-, so´ma-, agnı´-;
high-frequent are forms of V., N., A., G., I.), as
well as a´p- and dyu´-, the deified Waters and
Heaven (V., N., G. and V., N., A., respectively),
and, not surprisingly, the word deva-, ‘a deity,
god’ (N., A., G, L., V.). Consisting of seventy-eight
word types (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and
numerals), the frequent content word list corre-
sponds primarily to the vocabulary of the typical
formulaic expressions of the r
_
sq is and other
common means used in order to talk about conven-
tional topics: the gods and nature.

The HR is the ratio in percent between once-
occurring types (hapax legomena) and the vocabu-
lary size:
HR ¼ Number of once-occurring types  100%
Total number of types
ð3Þ
Hapaxes are words, often of obscure meaning
(Gonda, 1971, p. 172–73), which were used in the
corpus only once. They comprise 56% of the word
frequency list of the Rq V. Maximum relative number
of such types, 40%, was found in hymn 10.163,
which is practically repeated in the Atharvaveda,
the book of magical chants, as its purpose was to
charm away illness. The hymn contains some ‘med-
ical’ terminology, such as six out of nine Rq gvedic
attestations of ya´ksq mam, from ya´ksq ma-, ‘a name of
a disease’, vrq ha¯mi, from ˇvrq h, ˇbrq h, ‘to pull out’,
etc. Hymn 1.162, which praises a sacrificial horse
and where up to 25% of types are once-occurring,
gives an illustration of yet another source of unique
lexis: craftsmanship terminology (i.e. pa´dq bı¯s´am and
samq da´ a¨ nam, from pa´dq bı¯s´a-, ‘a fetterlock’, and
Samq dana-, ‘a bond’), which is rare in the collection
of priestly hymns. Although hapax frequency was
introduced by Wu¨st as a sign of lateness (Wu¨st,
1928, p. 14), a high value of HR essentially indicates
the originality of the hymn’s topic or a situation it
presumably dealt with (Edgerton, 1929, p. 278). It
may generally imply the use in a text of ‘highly
characteristic and specialised vocabulary suited
to . . . subject matter’ (Gamberini, 1983, p. 450) or
‘higher level of exactness of message content’ (Fox
and Fox, 2004, p. 117).
Family seal (C1) is a dichotomous category,
which presents an occurrence (or absence) in a
hymn of a repeated text fragment, defined as a clus-
ter of five words attested in the corpus at least twice.
Word clusters were viewed in the present study as
empirical traces of the family seals of the r
_
sq is,
refrains and catch-phrases of varying length which
laid down the claims of certain clans or ‘corpora-
tions’, sakha- (lit. ‘a friend’), of poets (Elizarenkova,
1999, p. 472) to certain books of the collection.
‘These clans were not willing to part with their
ancestral and secret knowledge. They indicate their
‘‘copyright’’ by a ‘‘clan seal’’: refrains, poets’ own
names, openly or disguised’ (Witzel, 1997, p. 261).
The most popular of such refrains is the phrase
‘yu¯ya´m pa¯ta svastı´bhihq sa´da¯ nahq ’ (‘protect us
always with your blessings’), which is attested in
eighty-two verses, mostly in book 7 (hymns 7.1,
7.3–7.4, 7.7–7.9, 7.11–7.14, 7.19–7.30, 7.34–7.37,
7.39–7.43, 7.45–7.48, 7.51, 7.53, 7.54, 7.56–7.58,
7.60–7.65, 7.67–7.73, 7.75–7.80, 7.84–7.88,
7.90–7.93, 7.95, 7.97–7.101, 9.90, 9.97,
10.65–10.66, 10.122); an inventory of repetitions is
given by Bloomfield (1916).
Manq dq ala (C2) characterizes the position of a
hymn in the collection and describes it as belonging
either to the family books (2–7) or the others (1,
8–10). The recension is traditionally divided into
ten books, or ‘circles’ (manq dq ala-). The hymns of
the family books were created by ‘poets of the
same family which handed them down as its heri-
tage’ (Gonda, 1975, p. 9). Book 9 contains only
hymns to Soma and is ‘ascribed to more than
sixty poets’ (p. 11), while books 1, 8, and 10 ‘were
not composed each by a distinct family of r
_
sq is, but
consist of groups of hymns based on identity of
authorship’ (p. 10). Hymn placement category is
non-linguistic and is derived from the traditional
arrangement of the corpus; it can arguably be
described as the time factor, since the family
books contain the oldest texts. But ‘all we can say
with confidence is that book 10, as such, is late but
judgment must be exercised for each individual
hymn. Some in book 8, sometimes even in book 1
and 10, can be as early as the ‘‘family
books’’ ’(Witzel, 1995, p. 310). In some cases analy-
sis results for individual books will be given.
Topic (C3) is a dichotomous category which deals
with the subject matter of the collection according to
the traditional definition. About one-half of the
hymns are dedicated either to Agni, Indra, or
Soma, the most frequently mentioned gods. Such
texts were united in this study in the group of
hymns to ‘popular’ deities. It should be noted that
hymns to Indra and Agni typically precede any others
in individual books, while Soma hymns form a sepa-
rate part of the collection (manq dq ala 9).
The scores for TTR, FCWR, and HR for each text
of the sample were calculated and tested for

significant differences between means within cate-
gories C1, C2, and C3 as determined by analysis of
variance (ANOVA). Categorical variables were
further analysed using the chi-squared statistic.
Collocations of five important content words
were retrieved from the corpus in order to reveal,
with the help of factor analysis, the interrelation of
ideas they represented. A collocation is ‘a lexical
relation between two or more words which have a
tendency to co-occur within a few words of each
other in running text’ (Stubbs, 2001, p. 24).
Collocations were extracted from the corpus with
ANTCONC 3.1.2 concordancer using the Mutual
Information (MI) coefficient which is effective for
identifying units of meaning, as it ‘picks out lexical
collocations’ (Stubbs, 1995, p. 39). Only colloca-
tions with high value of the coefficient (MI  5),
following Stubbs (p. 40), attested not less than five
times (Church and Hanks, 1990, p. 24) in the
window of five tokens around the node, were
taken into consideration. Context window size com-
plies with the recommendations of Sinclair et al.
(1997, p. 241 ff) and is usually equal to two padas,
i.e. half a verse of the Rq V.
4 Results
Table 1 shows results of the one-way ANOVAs com-
paring means in the groups of hymns classified
according with the occurrence of repeated clusters
(C1), placement in the collection (C2), and subject
matter (C3).
Books appear to differ according to the TTR,
irrespective of the attestation of either rare or fre-
quent words. Family manq dq alas generally score a
higher TTR, 80.22% versus 77.43%, which is a sig-
nificant difference (F¼ 7.72, P¼ 0.005), see Fig. 1A
and B for individual books.3 Book groups are indis-
criminate in respect of frequent content word and
HRs, although hymns in manq dq ala 9 (n¼ 13), if
compared with all the others combined, scored a
higher FCWR (7.61–5.11%, F¼ 20.71,
P¼ 0.00001) and a lower HR (1.33–2.85%,
F¼ 9.14, P¼ 0.003); both results are significant.
However, no significant result emerged for TTR in
between book 9 and the others (F¼ 0.14).
On Fig. 2 one can see that lexical diversity, scored
as FCWR and HR, differs significantly between
hymns with or without a family seal. More frequent
content word tokens and fewer hapaxes were used in
texts with repeated word clusters (F¼ 10.53,
P¼ 0.001 and F¼ 6.85, P¼ 0.009, respectively).
Yet the difference was not significant for this
factor on an ANOVA for TTR.
Concerning their subject matter, hymns do not
differ much in TTR score, but are distinguishable in
HR and FCWR (Fig. 3). Hapaxes occur at a signifi-
cantly lower rate in hymns dedicated to Agni, Indra,

dedicated to a popular deity and does not contain
repetitions (Fig. 4). No further ANOVA interaction
effects were found.
In terms of interaction of categorical variables, a
significant mutual dependence of C2 and C1 was
discovered. Repeated word clusters tend to appear
more in family books: 176 hymns without repeti-
tions to 253 with repetitions in manq dq alas 2–7, which
is a significant difference (2 ¼ 10.16, P¼ 0.001).
Manq dq alas 2–7 were exclusively associated with the
collectives of poets who viewed such ‘family
samq hita¯s’ as their exclusive intellectual heritage
(Witzel, 1997, p. 261).
One of the significant results so far is that the
occurrence of hapaxes and frequent content words
in a hymn is dependent on its addressee. Based on
the traditional data, this factor is both semantic and
receptive. It deals with the meaning put into the
texts by the members of the tradition. Since mean-
ing of a word is dependent on its use, we examined
contextual usage and interrelation of several high-
frequent content words, hereafter referred to as
‘headwords’: ı´ndra-, ‘the head of the Vedic
pantheon’, agnı´-, ‘fire and its personification’
soma-, ‘the Soma plant, ritual beverage made of it,
and a Vedic god’, a´p-, ‘deified Water’, and dyu´-, ‘the
Sky’. Each headword produced an above average
number of word forms (not less than three) in the
frequent types list. According to the method
described in the previous section, 614 node-collo-
cate pairs featuring the headwords were retrieved.
Collocation sets contained 267 types for ı´ndra-, 212
for agnı´-, 121 for so´ma-, 111 for a´p- and dyu´- com-
bined. Table 2 shows their relation.
It can be seen in Table 2 that there are more
collocates common to ı´ndra- and so´ma- than to
any other headwords. Indra, the most praised
deity, was repeatedly mentioned by seers as the drin-
ker of the sacred beverage, of which the god Soma is
the personification (i.e. in 2.11.11: ‘pı´ba¯-pibe´d indra
s´u¯ra so´mam ma´ndantu tva¯ mandı´nahq suta sahq ’,
‘Drink, drink, o hero Indra, soma! Let the joy-
giving pressed [juices] make you drunk’). Agni
and Indra (twenty-two common collocates) were
also occasionally paired by the poets, sometimes
forming a noun compound (indra¯gnı´-). For
example, although the initial verses in hymn 6.60
refer to the cosmogonic feat (v.1) which is typically
claimed as Indra’s, the myth is extended to Agni,
without, however, describing his specific function

In an attempt to find out what vocabulary
use can reveal about the r
_
sq is’ presuppositions
of cosmogony, we analysed collocates of a´p- or
dyu´- (‘nature’ headwords) intersecting with
those of ı´ndra-, agnı´- or so´ma- (‘deity’ headwords),
as the former represent two important
cosmological concepts, and the latter are the
actors of the creation myth (Kuiper, 1960).
Omitting function words and forms of the head-
words, the search resulted in the following colloca-
tion pairs.
 ahan 55 (ˇhan, ‘to smite, slay, hit, kill’) <apa´hq
10.9%,4 ı´ndrahq 20%>
 a´him 40 (a´hi-, ‘a snake’) <apa´hq 22.5%, ı´ndrahq

of anything’) <apam 32%, agnı´hq 24%>
 o´sq adhı¯hq 51 (o´sq adhi-, ‘a herb, plant’) <a¯pahq 25%,
apa´hq 9.8%, agnı´hq 9.8%>
 janita 30 (janitrq -, ‘a begetter, parent’) <ı´ndrasya
16.6%, divahq 26.6%>

10.7%, ı´ndrahq 10.7%>
 ga vahq 103 (go-) <a¯pahq 4.8%, so´mam 4.8%>
 napa¯t 31 (na´pat-, ‘descendant, offspring, son’)
<apam 51.6%, agne 16.1%>
 na´pa¯tam 20 (na´pat-) <apam 40%, agnı´m 25%>
 n r8n 44 (nrq -, ‘a man, hero, person; mankind,

 pa´tihq 97 (pa´ti-, ‘a master, owner, possessor,
lord’) <so´mahq 6.1%, divahq 10.3%>
 pavate 66 (ˇpu¯, ‘to make clean or pure or
bright, cleanse’) < so´mahq 40.9%, ı´ndra¯ya
12.1%, divahq 9%>
 prq thivyahq 98 (prq thivı -, ‘the earth or wide
world’) <divahq 60.2%, agnı´hq 7.1%>
 prq thivyam 31 (prq thivı -) <divı´ 35.4%, agnı´hq
16.1%>
 brq hata´hq 50 (brq ha´t-, ‘lofty, high, tall, great, large,
wide, vast’) <divahq 28%, agnı´hq 10%>
 vrq tra´m 83 (vrq tra´-, ‘an enemy, foe; N. of demon,
lit. resistance’) <apa´hq 14.4%, ı´ndrahq 21.6%>
 s´u¯ra 96 (s´u ra-, ‘a strong or mighty or valiant
man, warrior, hero’) < so´mam 6.2%, apa´hq
5.2%, indra 27%>
 su ryam 91 (su rya-, ‘the sun or its deity’) <divı´
19.7%, apa´hq 6.5%, agnı´m 7.6%>
Those words are habitually used with both
groups of headwords. Cross-comparison of the
referent verses highlighted hymns containing
what seems to be an instructive ‘summary’ of
the discourse, i.e. 1.32 (an extensive narration
of the feats of Indra, esp. vv.1–5), 1.103 (discovery
of creatures and plants by Indra, vv.2, 5), 5.29
(Indra and Soma, vv.2, 3, 8, also 4.28.1, 5), 2.35
(Agni as the son of waters, esp. vv.1–3, 7), 9.97
(Soma creating wide space, v.10 and gathering
poetic thoughts, v.34–35), 9.72 (Soma as the
master of cows, in vv.4–5, who is poured in rivers,
v.7), etc.
The aggregate of all contexts of headwords can
lead to the detection of latent structure of interrela-
tion between the respective concepts. For that pur-
pose collocation data listed above was summarized
as three variables: the absolute frequency of each
node and the frequency of its co-occurrence with
the two groups of headwords. Factor analysis
reduced the three variables to two factors. Factor 1
(F1) explains 47% of the variance observed in the
data and attributes to the frequency of a word. It
shows a highly positive loading of lexemes prq thivı -
and go-, which are, indeed, very frequent in absolute
terms. The association of a word with ‘deities’ on
the one hand and ‘nature’ on the other is accounted
for by Factor 2 (F2), which explains 37% of var-
iance. The factor loading on F2 was 0.83 for the
‘deity’ and –0.66 for the ‘nature’ headwords. A
highly positive loading on F2 is shown for the
root ˇpu¯, lexemes s´u ra-, vrq tra´-, and go-, seen
more often with the ‘deity’ headwords. In contrast,
a highly negative loading on F2 is exhibited by
prq thivı -, su rya-, o´sq adhi-, and na´pat-, which scored
more on the association with ‘nature’ (Fig. 5).
The words occurring in the ‘deity’ contexts would
be less relevant in the ‘nature’ contexts, and vice-
versa.

5 Discussion and Further Research
One of the main issues in Vedology is what phe-
nomena account for hymn structure. Two such fac-
tors are the situation of text production and features
of the poet. The former includes the addressee of a
particular text and its topic, while the latter includes
the poet’s world view and stylistic conventions, as
well as the attribution of a hymn to a particular
poetic collective. This article examined empirical
evidence of a relationship between the vocabulary
use and the texts’ subject matter (1) and both lin-
guistic and non-linguistic indications of poetic
family attribution: attestation of repetitions (2)
and the location of a text in the family core of the
collection (3). Following a descriptive stance, the
present research has shown that lexical diversity dif-
fers significantly between the hymns to ‘popular’
deities and where repeated text fragments were
found, and those dealing with other topics and
free from repetitions. The texts of the former kind
exhibit a higher rate of frequent content words and
contain fewer rare or obscure words. Although these
differences are small, they show a high statistical
significance. It is fair to say that the present study
employed only a part of the available linguistic
information, while the extraction of more data is
problematic. Nevertheless, the facts suggest a con-
siderable, systematic variety within the genre of
the Rq V.
A preliminary interpretation suggested here is
that the poets practiced different creative strategies
that shaped the complexity of the genre. The r
_
sq is
tended to adjust vocabulary to major topics and to
say things ‘pretty much the same way every time
they’re said’ (Jamison, 1997, p. 127). Yet there was
also a striving for a freer choice of subject matter
and lexis, seemingly represented by magical charms,
occasional, or ‘abnormal’ hymns, i.e. 10.106. A con-
siderable part of it is ‘mantras without meaning’,
containing over seventy once-occurring tokens,
which qualify it as untranslatable according to
Elizarenkova (1999, p. 508). Gonda writes about
book 10 as exhibiting ‘marked deviations from the
usual contents of the corpus’ (1975, p. 12). Perhaps
the trend is comprehensive: the ability of the genre
to contain heterogeneous texts, conservative on the
one side and challenging on the other, may be due
to the competitive nature of this form of poetry. The
characteristics of the speech situation, essentially a
verbal contest, should be taken into account, espe-
cially the setting and the norms of interaction
(Duranti, 1997). Pictured by Kuiper (1960) and
Thompson (1997), Aryan verbal contests were a
grand spectacle of the force of words. As
Thompson puts it, it was predominantly ‘a means
of self-display, . . . of one’s mastery of the exoteric
lexicon and, on the other hand, of one’s personal
authority and power’ (1997, p. 20). In such a situa-
tion lexical choice must have been strategic.
This study has shown that books are indiscrimi-
nate in terms of frequent content word and HRs,
although book 9, a liturgical manq dq ala dedicated
entirely to the god Soma in his ritual aspect, occu-
pies a somewhat different position. The observation
that it has more frequent words and less hapaxes
than the others agrees with the results of Wu¨st
(1928, p. 34 ff) and confirms Bloomfield’s notion
that book 9 ‘for the most part repeats itself’
(Bloomfield, 1916, p. 644). But contrary to Wu¨st
(1928, p. 14), the present research points out that
the trend is related to topic, as suggested by
Edgerton: ‘Rq gvedic poets when dealing with identi-
cal situations, tend strongly to use identical

language’ (1929, p. 278). Indeed, this explanation is
‘not related to the age of texts’ (Fosse, 1997, p. 45).
However, according to the present research, lexical
diversity judged by TTR differs significantly between
hymns in the family books and in the others. That
observation is not easy to interpret. The diachronic
nature of the corpus has to be taken into account:
hymns in family manq dq alas are commonly consid-
ered by scholars as the oldest. Is wider repertoire
of vocabulary (and grammar forms) in books 2–8
connected with the factor of time or, perhaps, geo-
graphy? Does it suggest that at some stage a degree
of uniformity was reached (i.e. in books 1 and 10)?
More data is required to answer these questions.
Conservative handling of discourse by the poets
might account for the stability of their favourite
themes, of which it can be fairly said that they
‘maintained their identity remarkably unchanged’
(Jamison, 1997, p. 138) through the entire period
of the floating oral tradition (Deshpande, 1993,
p. 134). Factor analysis has shown that regardless
of any particular difference in the poets’ conven-
tions, association of words with the lexemes denot-
ing popular deities and the elements is accounted
for by a single factor. This could be due to the
attribution of the lexemes to various components
of mythology rather than simply to individual char-
acters. Jamison notices that in Vedic narrative there
are ‘thematic building blocks that function as epi-
sodes in a number of different myths’, and that ‘in
these the action or situation remains constant, but
the participants vary’ (Jamison, 1997, p. 133). If
such a roughly Proppian model (Propp, 1968) is
adopted, the division between the agon (represented
by s´u ra-, ˇhan, vrq tra´-, go-), and etiology (prq thivı -,
su rya-, o´sq adhi-, na´pat-, janitrq -) would seem to be
pivotal (Fig. 5). The picture becomes clearer when
referent verses are compared. For example, in hymn
4.28 Indra is praised as ‘an ally’ and ‘a friend’ of
Soma (v.1: ‘tva yuja ta´va ta´t soma sakhya´ . . .’).
Indra is the hero who ‘made waters flow, slew the
serpent, released seven rivers’ (v.1: ‘ı´ndro
apo´ . . . sasru´tas kahq . . . a´hann a´him a´rinq a¯t sapta´
sı´ndhu¯n’), and ‘pressed down the wheel of Surya’,
i.e. the Sun (v.2: ‘nı´ khidat su ryasye´ndras´
cakra´mq . . .’). In the same hymn Agni is said to
have destroyed the enemies together with Indra,
‘Indra killed, Agni burned . . . the dasyus in the
collision’ (v.3: ‘a´hann ı´ndro a´dahad
agnı´r . . . da´syu¯n . . . abhıke . . .’), and in the closing
verse Soma is also given a tribute as Indra’s partner
who helped to release ‘horses and cows from a
hidden stall’ (v.5: ‘ı´ndras´ ca somorva´m a´s´vyamq
go´hq . . . ririca´thuhq ’). In contrast, in hymn 8.36
Indra is not only praised as the victor of all battles
(‘vı´s´va¯hq seha¯na´hq pr´
˚
tana¯ . . . ’), a refrain going
through the entire hymn, but also is admitted to
be ‘the begetter of the sky and earth, horses
and cows’ (v.4–5: ‘janita divo´ janita
prq thivyahq . . . janita s´va¯na¯mq janita ga´va¯m asi . . .’).
More or less the same things are said of Soma
in hymn 9.96: ‘Soma purifies, the begetter of
thoughts, . . . of the sky, earth, Agni, Surya, Indra,
and also Visq nq u’ (v.5: ‘so´mahq pavate janita
matı¯namq janita divo´ janita prq thivyahq . . . janita gne´r
janita su ryasya janite´ndrasya janito´ta´ vı´sq nq ohq . . .’),
even though the motif of his military chiefdom is
explicitly pronounced in the opening verse: ‘Forth
goes the hero, the chief, leading the chariots . . .’
(v.1: ‘pra´ sena¯nıhq s´u ro a´gre ra´tha¯na¯mq . . . eti . . .’).
The militant aspect of Agni, referred to as ‘the hero’
(s´u ra), is clearly implied in hymn 4.3: ‘Protect us,
Agni . . . kill the evil demon, even when he strength-
ens’ (v.14: ‘ra´ksq a¯ nq o agne . . . jahı´ ra´ksq o ma´hi cid
va¯vrq dha¯na´m . . .’), while a much less articulated
idea of his creative potency is linked with the
Waters, i.e. in hymn 3.1: ‘The parent, who begot
cows, the Child of Waters, . . . Agni’ (v. 12: ‘u´d
usrı´ya¯ ja´nita¯ yo´ jajana¯pamq ga´rbho . . . agnı´hq . . .’);
cf. in hymn 2.35: ‘The Son of Waters, . . . noble,
begot all creatures’ (v.2: ‘apamq na´pa¯d . . . vı´s´va¯ny
aryo´ bhu´vana¯ jaja¯na . . .’). In some sense Indra,
Soma, and Agni were equally assumed to be the
protagonists of the cosmogonic feat and the creators
of the differentiated world. A relative freedom of the
poet’s conceptual bricolage and of his lexical choice
must have been constrained by the need to put ideas
together in terms of birth or struggle. However, one
should keep in mind that this generalization con-
cerns not vocabulary use in general, but just in one
aspect—a strategy of the Vedic poet in unfolding
cosmologic discourse.
The idea behind this study was that regularity on
the lexical level might be more informative about

genre when analysed in the scope of cultural (and
receptive) categories. They were given preference
over deductive constructs and this brings about a
theoretical issue. In Jakobsonian, stylistics poetic
language functions ‘to point to the message’
(Watkins, 1995, p. 29) and is considered ‘a sort of
grammar’ (p. 28). Elizarenkova stresses the impor-
tance of a hymn’s ‘formal side’ and ‘the formal con-
struction of a piece of poetry’ (Elizarenkova, 1995,
p. 9) in a way that ‘the poetic function, the self-
orientation of language’ (p. 9) becomes essential
for the study of the Rq V. There remains a danger
with such constructs as the poetic (aesthetic, index-
ical, etc.) function, that ‘instead of referring to the
historical and structural concept of the literary
system (as an institutionalized set of discursive
norms and practices governing the production on
new texts), they can tend to hypostatize a quality
which resides in the text, to treat an analytic fiction
as an essential property’ (Frow, 1986, p. 95). It
remains to be demonstrated that an empirical nar-
ratological approach (cf. Klapproth, 2004), in the
tradition of Belyj (1934) and Propp (1968), presents
a plausible alternative to deductive stylistics. Further
research is required to analyse lexical choice in a
culturally specific genre in connection with narra-
tive components and reception. In my view such
research should be driven by corpus data.
