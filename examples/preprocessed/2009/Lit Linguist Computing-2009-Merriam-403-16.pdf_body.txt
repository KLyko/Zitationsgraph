
According to Professor Ward Elliott and Robert
Valenza, over the years, critics of their Shakespeare
Clinic’s findings are of two kinds, the favourable
and the not so favourable. Those favourable consist
of scholars who liked their conclusions and their
methods ‘such as Don Foster before 1986 and the
Oxfordians before 1990’, as well as ‘most of the
thirty-odd outside scholarly readers of our journal
articles.’ The not so favourable consist of those who
did not like the conclusions and those who did not
like their methods ‘such as literature department
numerophobes who think that crunching
Shakespeare is as gauche and perverse as drinking
from the finger bowl’ (Elliott and Valenza, 2004,
p. 362).
Such categorization into ‘all for’ or ‘all against’
implies that critical assessment of the Clinic’s meth-
ods is consequent on prior judgment of its

conclusions. I would suggest, on the contrary, that it
is possible to welcome some of the Clinic’s conclu-
sions and not others and to approve of some of the
Clinic’s methods and not others. Relegating all crit-
icism to the categories of pro and con fails to do
justice to MacDonald Jackson, one ‘of the [two]
greatest masters of authorship studies’ (Elliott and
Valenza, p. 361), whose disagreement with Elliott
and Valenza over the authorship of Hand D in Sir
Thomas More is based on painstaking attention to
the Clinic’s methods (Jackson, 2006).
At the outset, it is important to remember that
the founding purpose and original e´lan of the
Shakespeare Clinic of Claremont McKenna College
was to determine whether or not the author of
Shakespeare’s plays and poems was William
Shakespeare, born and died in Stratford-upon-
Avon, 1563–1616. Those who believe that he was
the author are termed ‘Stratfordians’ by the ‘anti-
Stratfordians’ who believe that ‘Shakespeare’ was a
nom-de-plume for another author deemed as wor-
thier of literary genius. Professor Elliott’s father was
an anti-Stratfordian, and he himself was similarly
inclined when he inaugurated the Clinic’s lengthy
and arduous researches.
Although in the United Kingdom the cause of the
anti-Stratfordians has come to be regarded as passe´
at best, in the USA it claims, according to Professor
Elliott, adherents among some in the legal profes-
sions. It is to Ward Elliott’s great credit that his
researches led him to acknowledge insufficient evi-
dence in favour of any of the possible anti-
Stratfordian claimants, and thus change his mind.
Elliott and Valenza succeeded in demonstrating
that no other claimant wrote a core canon of
twenty-nine Shakespeare plays. This achievement
can be overlooked by those for whom the
Stratfordian issue is not of primary importance.
The difficulty with the work of the Clinic lies not
in its original purpose and accomplishment, but in
auxiliary considerations, many which defy straight-
forward explanation. What follows is an appeal for
further and deeper consideration.
An essential first step in comparing Shakespeare
plays with non-Shakespeare plays is the screening of
a core canon of texts which may be assumed as
Shakespeare’s alone. Elliott and Valenza began
with thirty-eight plays. These were subsequently
reduced by eliminating 1 Henry VI, Timon of
Athens and all of Henry VIII, while retaining
‘Shakespeare’s’ parts of Pericles and The Two Noble
Kinsmen (Elliott and Valenza, 1996, p. 211). Further
pruning led to the establishment of a twenty-nine
play ‘clean, commonized baseline’ with the elimina-
tion of 2 Henry VI, 3 Henry VI, Henry V, all of
Pericles and all of The Two Noble Kinsmen (Elliott
and Valenza, 2004, p. 399).
The Clinic’s tests of authorship consist of seven-
teen ‘Round One Tests’ noted as ‘new-tech, hyphe-
nated words’ (Elliott and Valenza, 2004, pp. 408–9),
sixteen ‘Round Two Tests’ consisting of ‘contrac-
tions, metric fillers, selected words, and phrases,
per 20,000 words’ (Elliott and Valenza, 2004,
p. 412), and fifteen ‘Round Three Tests’ consisting
of ‘prefixes, suffixes, intensifiers, and adversions, per
20,000 words’ (Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 416).
Using these forty-eight stylistic criteria, Elliott and
Valenza provided two statistical analyses, the first of
which, Discrete Composite Analysis, uses univariate
statistics to establish a null hypothesis of each of the
forty-eight tests. The null hypothesis requires the
data for each individual test to fall (or not to fall)
within parameters that conform to those set by
the twenty-nine play ‘clean, commonized baseline’,
that is, the Shakespeare profile. The verdict for
each of the forty-eight tests is an acceptance or
a rejection. An acceptance does not evidence
Shakespearian authorship; a rejection indicates a
non-Shakespearean element in the forty-eight ele-
ment profile. The second method, Continuous
Composite Analysis, is one which is described as
follows:
This method (1) aggregates every
Shakespeare’s mean on every test into a
multi-dimensional composite mean; (2) then
measures a given text block’s distance, in stan-
dard deviations, from Shakespeare’s mean on
every test; and (3) then aggregates the
‘Shakespeare distance’ on every test into a
‘Continuous Composite Error’ (‘CCE’) score
(Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 350).
The results of both analyses are expressed in units of
probability, but they are not probabilities as

commonly understood. Table entries such as the
120 occurrences of ‘<1.000E–15’ in ‘Oxford by the
Numbers’ are expressed in statistical tables as simply
‘less than one-half of 1%’, or < 0.5%.
It is important to stress again that composite
probability scores, whether from Discrete or
Continuous analysis, are not indicators of the
absolute, actual probability that Shakespeare
wrote the block in question. Composite prob-
ability scores are markers from which com-
posite Shakespeare ranges are derived. The
scores permit comparison of the block in ques-
tion, not with the closest theoretically imag-
inable Shakespeare match, but with an actual
Shakespeare block at the edge of his range
(Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 351).
Elliott and Valenza present an overview of the
strengths and weaknesses of both analytical meth-
ods. Discrete Composite Analysis has the virtue of
being ‘easy to understand, compute, and present’
(Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 355). The Discrete
Composite probabilities for the twenty-nine plays
which constitute the Shakespeare baseline, or core
canon, range between 1.0 and 0.2316, well within
the accepted limits of the null hypothesis. But that
in itself ‘only gives one the crudest of notions of the
odds of Shakespeare authorship . . . ’ (Elliott and
Valenza, 2004, p. 355).
For the Elliott-preferred Discrete Composite
Analysis, each of the forty-eight tests for the
Shakespeare baseline is evaluated according to its
number of acceptances and rejections within its
respective twin set of high and low parameters.
How are these parameters determined? The pre-
ferred method is to determine the means and stan-
dard deviations, once given the set of twenty-nine
core canon plays and then verify which values fall
within (or without) two standard deviations of the
mean, plus or minus. Professor Elliott has used
instead an ad hoc approach or so-called ‘handfit-
ting’, whereby parameters are set generally accord-
ing to the maxima and minima range of the
twenty-nine plays. An element of circularity
enters into this procedure, as suggested by the
anomaly of Much Ado About Nothing with a
Discrete Composite probability of 0.6018 (one
rejection) based on ‘custom fitting’,1 or 0.0045
(five rejections) based on two standard deviations
from the mean. As Much Ado About Nothing is
accorded a strong prior probability as an all-
Shakespeare play, its Discrete Composite probability
can only fall within the acceptable limits of the null
hypothesis.
Additional difficulties, using the preferred
method, are apparent with Richard II (0.013), The
Merry Wives of Windsor (0.0045), Hamlet (0.013),
and Coriolanus (0.013). The establishment of the
twenty-nine play ‘clean, commonized baseline’ for
Shakespeare is therefore as much a product of
prior probabilities owing to received opinion of
Shakespeare scholars, as it is based on the numerical
methods of analysis used by the Clinic. Richard II
(0.033822), The Merry Wives of Windsor (0.012563),
Much Ado About Nothing (0.009988), and The
Tempest (0.0036895) also present difficulties
for inclusion, if one interprets the results of
Ccontinuous Composite probability as conventional
probabilities. The relatively early Richard II and the
late The Tempest contain unaccounted-for author-
ship features, possibly collaborative inputs; The
Merry Wives of Windsor and Much Ado About
Nothing are unusual in having 87% and 72%
prose, respectively. The discrepancy between the
prior probabilities of received scholarly consensus
and the findings of linguistic analysis, in principle
call for further investigation from both sides.
An equally serious reservation about Discrete
Composite Analysis concerns its use of univariate
statistics in making an overall tally for the forty-
eight tests. Individual tests are never 100% statisti-
cally independent as Elliott and Valenza tacitly
assume them to be with discrete analysis. The cor-
rectly adjusted weight of contributing evidence is
not the same for each of the forty-eight tests. Two
tests may parallel each other to such an extent that
their evidence constitutes less than that of two inde-
pendent tests. Yet the Clinic’s tally of rejections
treats each rejection as equal. The way to obviate
this unavoidable drawback of univariate statistics
is to adopt multivariate statistics (principal compo-
nent analysis).2 Multivariate analysis generally con-
firms the homogeneity of the twenty-nine play
baseline or core canon, and thus reinforces and

confirms the prior probability derived from conven-
tional scholarship.
An omission of the Shakespeare Clinic’s analysis
of its carefully assembled data is a thorough treat-
ment of the influence of time of composition upon
that data. The authors of ‘Oxford by the Numbers’
acknowledge the inability of Continuous Composite
Analysis to take the factor of time into
consideration.
. . . Continuous does not account for time
periods for traits like line endings, where
Shakespeare’s style changed over the years.
Discrete analysis distinguishes between early
and late profiles. Continuous does not
(Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 350).
In fact, neither of the two methods comprehensively
traces the effect of composition times on the results.
For Continuous Composite Analysis, date of com-
position is not taken into consideration. For
Discrete Composite Analysis, it is treated on an ad
hoc basis. Elliott and Valenza have specified early
and late (and sometimes, early, middle, and late)
parameters for eight of the forty-eight tests which
are obviously influenced by date of composition.
These tests are feminine endings and open lines
in Round One, ‘on’t’, ‘th’’, ‘i’th’’, and ‘’d-‘ld’ in
Round Two, and ‘very’ and ‘most’ þ modifier in
Round Three. Only the first two are ‘traits like line
endings’.
In all, there are seventeen of the forty-eight tests
in ‘Oxford by the Numbers’ which have values for
the core baseline which correlate significantly with
the given dates. They are rare words, feminine end-
ings, open lines, ‘the 2lws’, and BoB 7 in Round One;
total 1, ‘on’t’, ‘th’’, ‘i’th’’, ‘’ll’, ‘’d-‘ld’, and ‘’tis’ in
Round Two; ‘whereas | whenas’, ‘-able’, ‘most’ þ
modifier, ‘see’, and ‘hark | listen’ in Round Three.
All seventeen that could make use of the sub-
tabulation accorded the eight tests recognized as
being dominantly time dependent. The dates of
composition of every play tested by the Clinic
might then be checked before evaluating the results
of the seventeen tests. To do this would render the
already complex tabulation more complex, thus sub-
verting the claim that the process of Discrete
Composite Analysis is ‘simple and the results are
easy to understand, compute, and present.’3 This
counsel of perfection may be superfluous, but fur-
ther clarification of the matter of time dependency
would help an improved evaluation of the method.
At this point, visual comparisons are apposite.
Relevant data are tabulated in Appendix 1 for
Figs 1–3. Figure 1 is a diagram which plots the
Discrete Composite probabilities for the twenty-
nine play Shakespeare baseline against the dates of
composition provided by the authors of ‘Oxford by
the Numbers’. There are three tiers of probability,
0.2316, 0.6018, and 1, while the dates of composi-
tion number seventeen. A regression line is drawn
that indicates a low level of correlation between
dates of composition and the Discrete Composite
probabilities. The coefficient of 0.184 for n¼ 29 is
not significant of a correlation between the test
results and date of composition. That a significant
correlation actually exists for over one-third of
the forty-eight tests is demonstrable. Discrete
Composite Analysis fails adequately to reflect this
far from a negligible factor.
Figure 2 plots the Continuous Ccomposite prob-
abilities for the same plays against the same given
dates of composition. The correlation coefficient
of 0.229 for n¼ 29 is not statistically significant,
although it is unexpectedly greater than for
Discrete analysis, despite the disregard of chronol-
ogy in Continuous Analysis. It still fails to reveal the
importance of change over time in illustrating the
‘clean, commonized baseline’ of the twenty-nine
plays.
Principal component analysis, which takes into
consideration interdata dependence and ‘tele-
scoping’ of all forty-eight tests for the twenty-nine
plays, generates a first principal component with
17.7% of the total variation in the correlation
matrix. As the values for the first principal compo-
nent (PCA) are approximately normally distributed,
they are transformed into corresponding probabil-
ities which are plotted against the given dates of
composition shown in Fig. 3. The correlation coef-
ficient is 0.882 for n¼ 29, significant of a high
degree of correlation between probabilities and
dates. The Clinic’s imperfect handling of time
change creates an anomaly seen in the case of
Henry VIII below.

Elliott and Valenza divide Henry VIII into three
sections entitled H8(Sh), H8(Jt for Joint), and
H8(Fl). According to the electronic files shared
with the author by Professor Elliott, H8(Sh) consists
of 1.1 entire, 1.2 entire, 2.3 entire, 2.4 entire, 3.2.1–
3.2.203, 3.2.350–3.2.439, 4.2.1–4.2.82, 4.2.108–
4.2.173, 5.1 entire, and 5.2.182–5.2.215. H8(Jt) con-
sists of 1.4.65–1.4.107, 2.1 entire, 2.2 entire, 4.1
entire. H8(Fl) consists of 1.3 entire, 1.4.1–1.4.65,
3.1 entire, 3.2.204–3.2.349, 4.2.83–4.2.108, 5.2.1–
5.2.182, 5.3 entire, 5.4 entire, and epilogue (three
Arden line numbering). This somewhat complicated
division of the play is not made explicit in the
authors’ journal reports. All sections of Henry VIII
are assigned to the category ‘Dubitanda and set-
asides’, implying (correctly) that H8(Jt) and
H8(Sh) are of mixed authorship. It will be noted
that editors of the play have universally accepted
Shakespeare as author of 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 2.4,
3.2.1–3.2.203, and 5.1, which together constitute
81% of H8(Sh).
In a previous study, I determined that the matter
included in H8(Jt) is 73% by Fletcher and the
matter included in H8(Fl) is 97% by Fletcher.
Seventy-nine percent of the material in H8(Sh) is
by Shakespeare (Merriam, 2005). Elliott and
Valenza’s Discrete and Continuous Composite
Analyses award Shakespeare authorship to none of
the three divisions of Henry VIII. The twenty-nine
play Shakespeare baseline is displayed in Figs 4–7
with open circles, while Fletcher plays are shown in
black. Dates for the Fletcher plays are corrected in
accordance with Gordon McMullan’s entry for John
Fletcher in The Dictionary of National Biography.
Discrete Composite Analysis consigns H8(Sh),
along with H8(Jt) and H8(Fl), to a level consistently
below the ad hoc confidence level of 0.2316 estab-
lished by the twenty-nine play baseline. Appendix 2
gives the particulars for Figs 4–7.
Continuous Composite Analysis also makes lit-
tle distinction between the all-Fletcher H8(Jt) and

H8(Fl) on the one hand, and on the other, the
mainly Shakespeare H8(Sh) shown with a single
white circle at the base of the diagram. All parts of
Henry VIII are positioned well below the 0.0036895
ad hoc level of acceptance permitted for Shakespeare
authorship. It is misleading to say with regard to
H8(Sh) that ‘We believe that there are no glaring
clashes between our findings and what is suggested
by generally accepted documentary evidence’
(Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 360). The testimony
of Heminges and Condell as to Shakespeare’s
authorship of Henry VIII comprises, at least in the
parts universally accepted as Shakespeare’s, ‘gener-
ally accepted documentary evidence’.
PCA, in contrast, shows in Fig. 6 a clear diver-
gence between H8(Jt) and H8(Fl) on the one hand,
and H8(Sh) on the other. H8(Jt) has a probability
nearer to that of the Shakespeare plays than the
Fletcher plays, barring one collaborative play.
Fletcher and Massinger’s Sir John Barnavelt (1619)
is labeled ‘BARN’ to draw attention to its separation
from the other black-circled plays written solely by
Fletcher. All the Fletcher plays are linearly separated
from the Shakespeare baseline.
Most revealing is a plot of the second principal
component in Fig. 7. Here, the correlation with
time sequence for the Shakespeare plays is apparent;
it involves a sequence which includes H8(Sh) but
excludes H8(Jt) and H8(Fl) as well as the eight
Fletcher plays. H8(Sh) fits appropriately at the
base of the imagined regression line which connects
the Shakespeare plays. H8(Jt) and H8(Fl) belong to
a different associated cluster of plots. Fig. 7 illus-
trates the ability of PCA to encompass both author-
ship discrimination and chronological sequence.
What is the cause of the discrepancy between the
Clinic’s findings and those of PCA? H8(Sh) was
plausibly rejected because of its positioning later
than 1611, the last date within the Shakespeare
baseline.

It must be said that had Elliott and Valenza
strictly followed the principles of their authorship
inquiry, Henry VIII, either whole or in part, would
have been assigned to the category Apocrypha and
not ‘Dubitanda and set-asides’. H8(Sh)’s two given
probabilities, 2.768E–07 and 5.234E–07 are compa-
rable to those of the ‘Claimant Play Discrimination’
of Edward II with 1.337E–08 and 1.278E–07.
Only because of prior probabilities based on
literary criteria was Henry VIII included in the
category of ‘Dubitanda and set-aside’, rather than
removed from a Shakespeare association.
In the case of Timon of Athens, its rejections of
0.000000000004355 by Discrete Composite proba-
bility and 0.000000000000001 by Continuous
Composite probability, the same probability as
that of Thomas Dekker’s The Whore of Babylon,
should exclude it from the Dubitanda. The play is
held to be a collaboration by Shakespeare and
Thomas Middleton. The editor of the Oxford
Middleton, Gary Taylor states:
Middleton collaborated with the older play-
wright, writing about a third of Timon of
Athens, including the bitterly comic central
sequence where Timon’s creditors turn their
backs on him. Usually the most successful
scenes of the play in performance, these
apply classical tragedy techniques and
materials developed in Middleton’s recent
city comedies (Taylor, 2008).
Timon (17,704 words) with two-thirds of its matter
by Shakespeare is comparable to H8(Sh) (11,973
words) with four fifths by Shakespeare. In both
cases, their test results should indicate major
Shakespearean authorship. Using the methods of
the Shakespeare Clinic, they do not.
Elliott and Valenza’s analyses reject Timon as
they do Henry VIII (Shakespeare). Figures 8 and 9
show their results for Timon and the eight listed
Middleton plays (Elliott and Valenza, 2004,
p. 400). Middleton plays are presented in black
and Shakespeare baseline plays in white.
These results clash with ‘generally accepted doc-
umentary evidence’, based again on Heminges
and Condell’s inclusion of Timon in the 1623
Shakespeare First Folio. The Clinic’s findings for
H8(Sh) and Timon constitute false negatives,
belonging to the type II or b error which Elliott
and Valenza claim for the most part to avoid in
their study of authorship.
. . . our distinguishing stock-in-trade has been
‘silver-bullet’ evidence that tends to disprove
common authorship by showing differences,
rather than ‘smoking gun’ positive evidence
used by most other analysts to prove
common authorship with similarities such as

and Valenza, 2004, p. 337).
PCA, on the other hand, presents a picture in
Fig. 10 which harmonizes with the prior probabil-
ities of literary criteria. Not only is the factor of
chronological drift in the Shakespeare baseline
plainly present, Timon is shown to be the
Shakespeare play that is nearest to the cluster of
black circled Middleton plays.
Included among the ‘Dubitanda and set-asides’
in ‘Oxford by the Numbers’ is Pericles 3–5, univer-
sally held to be by Shakespeare alone. Figure 11
below indicates the results of Discrete Composite
Analysis.
Pericles 3–5 with a discrete probability of 0.06309
falls below the permitted confidence level of 0.2316
for the Shakespeare baseline, again type II error or
false negative. On the other hand, it passes
inside the Shakespeare threshold with Continuous
Composite Analysis, having a probability of
0.006864 just within the lower acceptable confi-
dence level of 0.003689.
PCA shows Pericles 3–5 in Fig. 13 to be comfort-
ably within the Shakespeare envelope and situated
approximately on the diagonal which correlates its
probability with date of composition.
Further examples could be provided for Two
Noble Kinsmen (Sh’s part), Henry VI, Part 2, and
Titus Andronicus—late stratum, all listed among
texts of the ‘Dubitanda and set-asides’. Principal
component analysis in these instances, as with
those above, gives a more nuanced picture than
Discrete and Continuous Composite Analyses.
This is because Discrete and Continuous Analyses
were designed to lead to a bivalent decision ‘as to
one of only two possible results, that is the accep-
tance or rejection of a hypothesis’ (Howson and
Urlach, 1989). They are unsuited to the gradations
of Shakespearian co-authorship which are arguably

present in varying degrees in the canonical
Shakespeare history plays, along with Titus
Andronicus, Edward III, Sir Thomas More, Timon
of Athens, Pericles, Macbeth, and Two Noble
Kinsmen. The originating thrust of the Shakespeare
Clinic’s work was directed, as previously stated,
toward testing the hypothesis that the solo works
of Shakespeare were written by a non-Shakespeare
Claimant—yes or no.
. . . the null hypothesis is never proved or
established, but is possibly disproved in the
course of experimentation. Every experiment
may be said to exist only to give the facts a
chance of disproving the null hypothesis
(Fisher, 1947).
Fisher’s formulation of classical statistics agrees with
Popper’s view that while theories cannot be proven
by empirical evidence, they can sometimes be dis-
proved by them. Elliott and Valenza’s refutation of
the hypothesis that any named Claimant wrote
Shakespeare’s core canon follows this template.
The strategy used is one which regards positive
empirical evidence of little or of no value; only neg-
ative evidence is utilized to refute the null hypoth-
esis once formulated.4
In Professor Elliott’s words:
Our tests are more like comparing shoe sizes,
blood typing, or eye color than comparing
fingerprints. If our tests are defined and mea-
sured properly, they will show tons of false
positives but no more than ounces or
pounds of false negatives. We believe that neg-
ative evidence normally outweighs positive
evidence by many orders of magnitude. As
noted, fitting a tiny slipper does not prove
you are Cinderella nearly as conclusively as
not fitting the tiny slipper proves you are not
Cinderella. If you are a size four, you could
just as well be a false positive Little Miss
Muffet or Tiny Tim; but, if you are a size
ten, your claim to be Cinderella is in trouble.
The trouble is compounded, and the disproof
stronger, for every additional profile you do
not fit – hat size, height, eye color, or blood
type – making it easy to eliminate a Cinderella
claimant even if uncanny numbers of other
measurable features – sex, ring size, hair
color, inseam, resting pulse rate, cholesterol
level, or blood pressure – seem to match
exactly. Hence, our distinguishing stock-in-
trade has been ‘silver-bullet’ evidence that
tends to disprove common authorship by
showing differences, rather than ‘smoking
gun’ positive evidence used by most other
analysts to prove common authorship with
similarities such as ‘borrowings’ or ‘echoes’
(last italics mine) (Elliott and Valenza, 2004,
p. 337).

There are several difficulties with this argument.
First, the evidence of shoe size and blood type, if
not eye color, is measurable in a deterministic sense.
One’s shoe size, as it were, is either four or five, or
ten. One has blood type A, B, AB, or O. The mea-
surements of the Shakespeare Clinic, on the other
hand, are probabilistic. Their status as decisive pos-
itive or negative evidence is dependent on para-
meters which can never be certain, even using
conventionally approved limits like two standard
deviations, and indeed less so with the subjective
use of ‘handfitting’ the parameters.
The second difficulty is the assumption that
emphasis on negative evidence in refuting a hypoth-
esis is unassailable in logic. This involves the insol-
uble problem of deduction from induction. Fisher
was careful to include the word ‘possibly’ in his
statement quoted above. Popper included the
word ‘sometimes’, and Elliott and Valenza have
included the collocation ‘tends to’. These are, never-
theless, words that are easily forgotten in the course
of an argument backed by Elliott’s metaphorically
rich rhetoric.
A third difficulty is the failure of the authors to
clarify what is meant by a false negative. The term
itself reflects the either-or nature of the investiga-
tion, core baseline compatible or not. The authors
assume, without being explicit, that a negative ver-
dict entails a rejection of the established ‘clean,
communized baseline’ of twenty-nine plays. By set-
ting the threshold of the Continuous Composite
Analysis at the lowest probability observed for the
given baseline, namely 0.003689, they guarantee the
existence of true positives and the absence of false
positives, as pre-defined solely in terms of the core
baseline. The calibration of Valenza’s Continuous
Composite probabilities eliminates all other plays
from the baseline besides Henry VI, Part 2, with a
probability of 0.2724 and Pericles 3–5 with a prob-
ability of 0.006864, both having the values above the
threshold of 0.003689.
On the other hand, if a negative verdict is defined
as the rejection of a text which is not all or part by
Shakespeare according to implicit prior probabilities
on literary grounds, as in the case of Henry VI, Part
1, Henry VI, Part 3, Henry V, Henry VIII, Two Noble
Kinsmen, and Titus Andronicus, then the resulting
calibration of the Continuous Composite probabil-
ities creates false positives of all the Claimant and
Apocryphal plays. Some of the existing Dubitanda
negatives have Continuous Composite probabilities
which are infinitesimal, namely Henry VI, Part 1, the
10,609 words of Titus Andronicus, Timon of Athens
entire, and Hand D of Sir Thomas More, all with less
than 1E–15.
Seventy-five plays tested have an undifferentiated
probability of less than 1E–15. It is hard to believe
that such an equally vast difference from
Shakespeare can be generated by so many different
works in the same language. Had the calibration of
Valenza’s analysis been set to ignore gradations of
authorial resemblance simply in order to avoid false
positives?
Finally, there is the definition of false negatives
and true positives in terms of the statistical
probabilities as ‘indicators of the absolute, actual
probability that Shakespeare wrote the block in
question’. This would follow the tradition of classi-
cal statistics, but would fail to confirm the authorial
configuration of texts in ‘Oxford by the Numbers’
by rejecting several of the baseline plays as false
positives.
Much the same can be said for Discrete
Composite probabilities. These are set with a
boundary threshold of 0.2316, thus eliminating all
plays other than Henry V with the apparent false
positive of a probability of 0.2316. As the number
of rejections for individual plays making up the core
baseline is based on ‘handfitting’, and as the prob-
ability threshold is calibrated after their transforma-
tion into Discrete Composite probabilities to fit the
twenty-nine play baseline, the logic of the exercise
requires further serious explanation.
Having said this, it remains that it is ambiguous
as whether the quotation refers to the false negatives
at the macro level as I have considered them, or
whether the quotation refers only at the micro
level to the false negatives that occur among the
forty-eight tests of Discrete Composite Analysis.
This ambiguity should be clarified.
To return to the matter of the choice of bound-
aries for the discrete univariate analysis, the authors
state that ‘we find that no core Shakespeare baseline
play has more than two individual rejections

(shaded aqua) in forty-eight tests, while no
‘Claimant’ play has fewer than ten rejections’
(Elliott and Valenza, 2004, p. 338). While ‘unwaver-
ingly using machine-defined boundaries’5 within
the limits of two standard deviations from the
mean for the twenty-nine play baseline, I found
that Much Ado About Nothing and The Merry
Wives of Windsor had five rejections each instead
of one and two. They are plays with the highest
proportion of prose with 87% and 72%, respectively
(Wells and Taylor, 1987). Three plays, Richard II,
Hamlet, and Coriolanus, had four rejections. Four
plays, Two Gentlemen of Verona, Othello, Cymbeline,
and The Tempest had three rejections. Although the
increased number of rejections for the baseline plays
does not alter their relationship with the fifty-one
Claimant plays with ten or more rejections, it does
alter their relationship with Dubitanda plays such as
Henry VI, Part 2, with two rejections, Henry V with
five rejections, Henry VIII (Shakespeare’s part)
with four rejections, and Two Noble Kinsmen
(Shakespeare’s part) with four rejections.
It is worth remarking that the correlation
between rejection counts based on two standard
deviations from the mean, ‘unwaveringly using
machine-defined boundaries’, and the Continuous
Composite probabilities for the twenty-nine play
baseline is greater than that between the ‘handfitted’
rejection counts of Professor Elliott and the same
Continuous probabilities of Professor Valenza.6
A fourth difficulty lies in the absence of an
expressed consideration of the essential part played
in the selection of a core baseline by prior probabil-
ities from scholarly consensus. The Tempest, for
example, with a Continuous Composite probability
of 0.003689 is included in the baseline because of
the unassailable confidence on the part of scholars
and actors that it is uniquely the work of
Shakespeare. In Bayesian statistical analysis, this
prior belief would be accorded a probability esti-
mated to be high enough to overcome any empiri-
cally derived evidence to the contrary. Only the ad
hoc adoption of the Continuous Composite bound-
ary set by The Tempest permitted it to remain within
the framework of the ‘clean, communized baseline’.
Similarly, Hamlet, its four rejections with two stan-
dard deviations from the mean giving it a Discrete
Composite probability of 0.013, must be included in
a Shakespeare core baseline because of its defining
quality as essentially Shakespeare. Pericles 3–5 with a
Discrete Composite probability of 0.06309 finds
itself excluded from the core baseline, although its
literary status as Shakespeare’s would give it a
Bayesian prior probability in excess of the arbitrary
baseline boundary of 0.2316. Some discussion of the
varied role of ‘subjective’ prior probabilities is
appropriate.

every test run, on every core baseline Shakespeare
play, we find 98% true positives and only about 2%
false-negative Shakespeare rejections. Applying the
same process to fifty-one plays mostly by claimants
produces 65% false-positive results. We ignore this
result because false–positive results do less to prove a
Shakespeare ascription than the false-negative results
disprove it, and 35% true negatives, with a bit of aggre-
gation, are more than enough to rule out fifty-one plays
as Shakespeare’s solo work’. Note that in this passage
Dubitanda plays are not mentioned.
