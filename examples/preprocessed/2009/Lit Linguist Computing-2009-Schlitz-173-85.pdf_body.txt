A significant number of digital editions have been
published in recent years, and many of these serve as
exemplars for those of us working within the digital
editing community. A glance at Electronic Textual
Editing, for example, published in 2006, indicates
that such projects address a wide berth of editorial
problems, ranging from transcriptional practices to
document management to authenticity. And they
offer a wealth of information to editors working
on various types of digital editions.
While much has been written about the chal-
lenges of digital editions, in the discussion that
follows, I consider a problem that has yet to be
resolved. My discussion centers on the difficulties
that arise in editing a single, albeit somewhat un-
usual, Icelandic saga: Hafgeirs saga Flateyings. This
saga is preserved in an unsigned, eighteenth-century
paper manuscript, Additamenta 6, folio (Add. 6,
fol.). Today housed in the collection of the Arni
Magnusson Institute for Icelandic Studies in
Reykjavı´k, Iceland, the manuscript was originally
held as part of the Arnamagnæan Collection in
Copenhagen, Denmark. According to the flyleaf:
‘Saga af Hafgeyre flateying udskreven af en
Membran der kommen er fra Island 1774 in 4to
exarata Seculo xij’ (Hafgeirs saga Flateyings was
copied from a twelfth-century manuscript written in
quarto, which came [to Copenhagen] from Iceland in
1774).
While such a manuscript might appear unre-
markable, as a number of paper manuscripts were
copied during the late eighteenth century in
Copenhagen, then the capital of Iceland and the
seat of Icelandic manuscript transmission during
this period, only twelve Old Icelandic manuscripts
of those catalogued in the Copenhagen collections
are dated to the twelfth century, while a mere eigh-
teen are dated to 1200 (Jorgensen, 1977; Kalund,
1900, p. 512). The dating on the flyleaf is therefore
unusual, and, as it turns out, suspect as well,
since no catalogue entry exists to record the occur-
rence of the alleged source manuscript. Moreover,

as Jorgensen observes, the motif sequence found in
Hafgeirs saga Flateyings bears a striking resemblance
to that found in the well-known mythical-heroic
saga Ha´lfdanar saga Bro¨nufo´stra (Jorgensen, 1977).
And in a fascinating argument based primarily on
this fact, Jorgensen alleges that Add. 6, fol. is a forg-
ery, claiming that Þorla´kur Magnu´sson I´sfiord, an
Icelandic student who was studying and working as
a copyist in Copenhagen during the 1780s, com-
posed and sold Hafgeirs saga Flateyings as a copy
of an authentic medieval Icelandic saga (Jorgensen,
1977).
In spite of its questionable origin, Hafgeirs saga
Flateyings stands as a remnant of Iceland’s literary,
linguistic, and intellectual history, and Add. 6, fol.
can therefore be viewed as an important cultural
artefact.1 As the editor of the Hafgeirs saga Flateyings
manuscript, my aim is to provide a ‘reliable’ (see the
Modern Language Association’s ‘Guidelines for
Editors of Scholarly Editions’ Section 1.1) electronic
edition of the text. But the question, at least until
recently, was how? What is the best way to represent
such a work? Encoding the manuscript according to
a markup standard such as the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) Guidelines is surely a starting
point, but doing so doesn’t solve one of the primary
concerns: How to represent the manuscript reliably
(which presents a complex editorial problem of its
own), while at the same time describing literary,
linguistic, and transmission-level ‘interpretations’
that can offer readers insight into the saga’s origin
and the manuscript’s transmission history.
At the 2007 Digital Humanities Summer
Institute, Matthew Driscoll gave a talk entitled
‘Everything But the Smell: Toward a More
Artefactual Digital Philology.’ The talk provided a
brief history of the shift toward ‘new’ philology (see
Speculum Vol. 65, No. 1, January 1990) and under-
scored the significance of the material or ‘artefac-
tual’ aspect of new philology, which views
manuscripts as physical objects and thus as cultural
artefacts which offer insight into the ‘process to
which they are witness’ (Driscoll, 2007b). In his
discussion of ‘artefactual philology’, Driscoll
emphasized the distinction between artefact, the
‘physical object which carries the text,’ and
text, the ‘series of words in a particular order’
(Driscoll, 2007b). And in a related article he urged
editors working within the artefactual tradition to
‘retain as many features of the original, and
[to] introduce as little interpretation, as possible’
(Driscoll, 2007c). While Driscoll grants that interpre-
tations must be added to zero-level text if it is to be
of use to its readers, he cautions that ‘it should always
be clear what is actually written in the source, as
distinct from however the editor has decided this is
to be interpreted; wherever one is, one must always
be able to get back to level zero’ (Driscoll, 2007c).
Yet in the case of Hafgeirs saga Flateyings, where
one of the edition’s aims is to offer readers the
ability to assess the text’s authenticity, the editing
process relies on interpretations. By definition,
forensic philology portends a kind of evidentiary
approach, one that frames interpretations of the
text as kinds of evidence. Evidence of what? That is
in the hands of the editors and the readers, but con-
ceivably: linguistic development, the transmission
process, literary typology, and so on. Because the
descriptive framework of TEI’s P5 Guidelines defines
Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the under-
lying encoding language, artefactual philology and
forensic philology need not be mutually exclusive.
TEI-XML digital editions afford editors the ‘logic of
abundance’ (Flanders, 1997, p. 135), such that encod-
ing the metadata described in interpretations beside
the data described in (near)zero-level text can be
accomplished without sacrificing the role of the
manuscript as artefact and without sacrificing the
appearance of the text as it occurs on the page; thus:
artefactual philology¼ (near)zero-level text:
TEI-XML maintains the separation between
(near)zero-level text and a minimum of inter-
pretations
forensic philology¼ ‘interpretations’: TEI-XML
describes the linguistic, literary, and
transmission-level aspects of the text that
can point toward transmission history and
origin while maintaining the separation
between (near)zero-level text and
interpretations

And as a result of the encoder’s ability to separate
data and metadata, there is, as Driscoll suggests,
‘no limit to the information one can add to a text
– apart, that is, from the limits of our own imagina-
tion’ (Driscoll, 2007a).
To be sure, this paper does not lapse into what
McCarty refers to as the ‘mimetic fallacy’ (see
Dahlstro¨m 2004, p. 24), but it does support the
premise that digital editions, which foster the dis-
tinct layering of data and metadata, have the poten-
tial to move the reader beyond the aesthetics of
sensory experience, and perhaps even to offer some-
thing that cannot be obtained via the olfactory sen-
sation of smell.
In the remainder of this paper, I explain how I
employ a forensic framework to address the pro-
blem of editing the Hafgeirs saga Flateyings manu-
script, and I show how I describe and display
literary, linguistic, and transmission-level interpre-
tations of the text, which are precisely the kinds of
interpretations that can bear witness to its origin
and the transmission process.
2 From Artefactual to Forensic
Philology
The problem of authenticity raises a unique set
of philological questions: Which constituents of
the text can be identified as potential evidence of
authenticity or inauthenticity? The editorial
response to this question demands a particular
kind of encoding, one that exploits XML to describe
not only the various literary, linguistic, and
transmission-level aspects of the text but also the
various ways of displaying and analysing these
data, and one that allows readers to do the same.
In short, the encoding and display should be
designed to allow readers to ‘generate’ (see
Vanhoutte, 2006) an edition that can display or
suppress descriptors that can lead them to their
own conclusions about the text’s origin.
In keeping with this editorial goal, I defined three
‘forensic’ categories for this project:
1. Literary: describes motif sequences and poetic
lines found in the text (could also include other
types of literary information; e.g. poetic devices
such as enjambment, rhyme scheme, kennings,
etc.)
2. Linguistic: describes lexical, morphological, and
orthographic aspects of the text (does not focus
on orthography strictly, since it is unreliable as a
dating factor in this case)
3. Transmission-level: describes altered, corrected,
or erroneous aspects of the text
From a TEI-XML perspective, these categories are
organized to include the elements and attributes
described in Table 1.
To include additional comments and to link ele-
ments, I also incorporated the <note> and <ptr>
(pointer) elements from the ‘Elements Available in
All TEI Documents’ Module of the TEI P5
Guidelines, and the <link> element from the
‘Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment’ Module of
the TEI P5 Guidelines. I then designed the transfor-
mation of the source XML to display interactively
the interpretations of the text described by these
elements and attributes so that readers can view or
suppress the interpretations and in doing so ‘gen-
erate’ their own versions of the edition. Readers can
display archaisms, for example, and assess whether
they are ‘affectation[s] of spurious age’ (Einar,
1958, p. 39) or features consistent with the textual
transmission process, and they can view post-
Reformation borrowings, for example, and assess
whether they preclude a medieval origin or are to
be expected in a text ostensibly copied by a scribe
living in Copenhagen during the eighteenth century.
Or they can suppress these features and, for

view the editorial notes, view one or more of the
motifs, compare motifs, or any combination of
these.
2.1 Literary interpretations
The literary grouping represents an extension of the
work begun by Jorgensen. His description of the
motif sequence shared by Hafgeirs saga Flateyings
and Ha´lfdanar saga Bro¨nufo´stra is as depicted in
Figs 1 and. 2, where the numbering of the motifs
in the English Hafgeirs saga Flateyings summary cor-
responds with the numbering of the motifs in the
English Ha´lfdanar saga Bro¨nufo´stra summary.
While I adopted the motif sequence and the
motifs2 as defined by Jorgensen, rather than rely
on English outlines to illustrate the shared narrative
structures, I turned to the text in Add. 6, fol. and
encoded the motif sequence and individual motifs
using the <interpGrp> (interpretation group),
<interp> (interpretation), and <seg> (segment)
elements as defined in the ‘Simple Analytic
Mechanisms’ Module of the TEI P5 Guidelines
(see 17.3: ‘Spans and Interpretations’). The
<interpGrp> element ‘collects together a set of
related interpretations which share responsibility
or type’ (TEI, 2008) and nests within it the child
element <interp>, which ‘summarizes a specific
interpretative annotation which can be linked to a
span of text’ (TEI, 2008).
In this edition, <interpGrp> contains the
motif sequence, and each <interp> describes a
motif within the sequence, as in the following
example:
<interpGrp resp¼"#SAS" type¼"MotifSequence">
<interp xml:id¼"FOSTERa">"The king has his
friend, Earl Skate, foster Fenesius because he knows
his queen prefers their two older sons."</interp>
<interp xml:id¼"DAYLONG_HUNT">"At age 12,
Fenesius runs off alone on a day-long chase after a
hare."</interp>
1. King Artus of Sweden has a daughter and three sons, the youngest named 
Fenesius. 2. (1) The king has his friend, Earl Skate, foster Fenesius because he 
knows his queen prefers their two older sons. 3. (5a) At age 12, Fenesius runs off 
alone on a day-long chase after a hare. 4. (5h) When he does not return, the earl is 
so worried that he cannot eat or sleep for eight days. 5. (5b) Meanwhile, Fenesius 
meets a cannibalistic troll, whom he kills by burying his ax in the giant’s head. 6. 
(5c) He then decapitates and burns the troll’s mate, Lúpa, at her house before 5d) 
finding Godfreyia chained to a post. 7. (5e) The girl tells him to save himself 
because the giant will kill him if he finds him there. 8. After learning the troll is 
dead, (5f) Godfreyia relates that it had killed her parents. 9. They burn the giants’ 
house down and (5g) go to Godfreyia’s sister with gems. There the two women 
heal Fenesius. 10. Godfreyia then becomes pregnant by Fenesius, and they decide 
to have the earl bring up the child if a boy and the mother raise it if a girl. 11. 
Fenesius returns alone to camp. 12. (3) After just having turned 12 [sic], Fenesius 
asks the earl if he can go on a Viking expedition and is given twelve ships by the 
earl and six by his father. 13. After a successful venture, (4) his ship is separated 
by a storm. 14. (2) He and his companions are attacked by Vikings led by Sóti, 
who kills Fenesius. Upon learning the sad news, his father dies of grief. 15. (1) 
The son of Fenesius and Godfreyia, Hafgeir, is raised by Earl Skate until the 
latter’s death. 16. (7) The boy sails about as a merchant and stays with Hálfdan 
the Black, King of Norway. He proves his prowess by bringing the king booty 
from a Viking trip. 17. (8) With weapons given him by King Hálfdan, he leaves to 
avenge his father and finally buries his sword in Sóti’s brain. 18. On his way 
back, he is blown off course, winters on Flatey (whence the epithet of the hero), 
returns to Norway, later marries and has many famous descendents.

Introduction: The saga opens with the genealogy of King Hringr of Denmark, 
who has a daughter, Ingibjörg, and two sons, the elder called Ásmundr and the 
younger called Hálfdan. 1. The king’s friend, Earl Þorfiðr, fosters the children 
until 2. they are attacked by vikings led by Sóti, who kill the king and his elder 
son and defeat his army. The earl hides Ingibjörg and Hálfdan with an old lady in 
the woods for a short time before sending them away to be fostered by his brother, 
Earl Óttarr. 3. After turning twelve, Hálfdan asks the earl if he can go on a viking 
expedition and is given four ships. 4. His ship is separated by a storm and on 
landing, 5a. he goes off alone on an all day hunt. 5b. Hálfdan meets two 
cannibalistic trolls in a cave and kills the male by chopping off its head with his 
axe before 5c. decapitating the giant’s mate after a lengthy battle. 5d. He finds 
Hildr tied to a chairpost in an arm of the cave and 5e. the girl tells him to save 
himself because the giant will kill him if he finds him there. After learning that 
the troll is dead 5f. Hildr and Hálfdan find her two brothers who had been about 
to be killed by the giant. 5g. They stay in the cave for five nights before taking 
gold, silver, and jewels with them to camp and to Hálfdan’s sister, 5h. who was so 
worried that she could not eat or sleep for days. Following adventures with a troll-
woman, Brana, who becomes Hálfdan’s lover, 6. becomes pregnant by Hálfdan, 
and they decide to to have the father bring up the child if it is a boy and to have 
the mother do as she likes if it is a girl. 7. Hálfdan sails as a merchant and stays 
with Ólaf, King of England, and proves his prowess by defeating the evil Áki. 8. 
Along with the twenty ships given to him by King Ólaf’s daughter, he leaves to 
avenge his father and finally does so by chopping off Sóti’s legs. He remains in 
Denmark before returning to England, marries the king’s daughter and has a 
famous son.

The English descriptions contained in each
<interp> are taken from Jorgensen’s original sum-
mary, while the @xml:id was added during the edit-
ing process. A series of <seg> tags, which ‘may be
used at the encoder’s discretion to mark almost any
segment of the text of interest for processing’ (TEI,
2008), is used in the body of the saga to wrap
Icelandic text which contains the motifs described
in the <interp> elements, and each <seg> is linked
to its corresponding <interp> by means of the @ana
(analysis). For example, the motif Couldn’t eat or
sleep for days is described by <interp xml:id¼
"COULDNT_EAT_OR_SLEEP_FOR_DAYS">
within the <interpGrp> and is expressed in the
body of the saga as:

Because it is constructive in this edition to enable
readers to compare the motifs in Hafgeirs saga
Flateyings with those in its alleged source text, I
also identified and encoded the motif sequence

2.2 Linguistic interpretations
In representing linguistic interpretations, I focused
primarily on lexical and morphological description,
since these are often useful indicators in determin-
ing a text’s date. While the textual transmission
process is known to introduce changes in text,
orthographic changes in particular, the dates of lex-
ical items such as content words like nouns, verbs,
and adverbs that are central to the narrative can be
indicative of the text’s date. In this case, it might be
argued, as Jorgensen notes, that the twelfth century
dating on the flyleaf provides ‘a convenient terminus
post quem’ (Jorgensen, 1977, p. 163), and should a
reader determine that a sufficient number of late
loan words and modernisms are present, sixteenth
century borrowings and seventeenth century nouns
for example, he or she might leverage relative chro-
nology to rule out a twelfth century source. On the
other hand, the presence of archaisms may lead a
reader to a different conclusion: either that the text
stands as a remnant of Icelandic at an earlier stage
and is therefore authentic or perhaps that the scribe
intentionally archaized the text to give the impres-
sion of an early medieval source.
In order to facilitate these kinds of analyses, the
edition’s schema4 defines four new elements. Drawn
from the perspectives of historical and socio-
linguistics, these elements have been selected to
aid readers in a linguistic evaluation of the saga:
1. The < borrowing> element describes a non-
native word which has been adopted into the
language. Distinct from the <foreign> element,
a borrowing may have the following attributes:
@sourcelang (source language), @borrowdate
(date of borrowing), and @borrowtype (type of
borrowing; e.g. calque, such as ubermensch bor-
rowed from German and translated into English
as ‘Superman’; or loanword), in addition to the
TEI global attribute set.
2. The < modernism > element describes a word,
phrase, usage, or peculiarity of style which repre-
sents an innovative or distinctively modern
feature.
3. The <neologism> element describes a word or
phrase which is new to the language or one
which has been recently coined.
4. The <archaism> element describes an
archaic morphological, phonological, or syntactic
feature or an archaic word, phrase, expression,
etc.
Because the linguistic assertions made by this
type of encoding rely on secondary sources5 to
inform the content, these descriptors are generally
encoded with an accompanying <note> element
providing the reference and/or other relevant
source information, and where a word or usage
occurs repeatedly, subsequent instances of the
word or usage are linked to the original note by
means of a <ptr>.
2.3 Transmission-level interpretations
Transmission-level interpretations are often descrip-
tive rather than interpretive (e.g. <del>, <add>,
<gap>, and <abbr> where indicated by the
scribe), though some, including <corr>, <sic>,
and <reg>, remain interpretive. The majority of
the TEI-XML elements included in this category
are discussed in the ‘Elements Available in all TEI
Documents’ Module of the TEI P5 Guidelines,
including those shown in Table 3.
The <supplied> element, which ‘‘signifies text
supplied by the transcriber or editor for any
reason, typically because the original cannot be
read because of physical damage or loss to the ori-
ginal’’ (TEI, 2008) has also been enlisted from the
‘Representation of Primary Sources’ Module of the
P5 Guidelines. Together, these descriptors are
designed to aid the reader in drawing conclusions
about the transmission of the text. For example, a
reader might conclude based on apparent errors
such as homoeoteleuton, for example:
<lb/><sic>ı´</sic><note>Homoeoteleuton:
<emph rend¼"italics">ı´</emph> is written
twice.</note>
or dittography, for example:
<lb/><sic>hefir</sic><note>Dittography:
<emph rend¼"italics">hefir</emph> is
written twice.</note>

document, an earlier exemplar manuscript, a draft

3 Transformation and display
The display of the edition, and in particular the
three encoding groupings, is generated by a custo-
mized implementation of the TEIViewer,7 an appli-
cation consisting of a TEI-XML source layer, an
XSLT transformation layer, and a jQuery-driven
interactive layer. This application allows readers,
by means of a control panel, to select
descriptions and interpretations of the text to dis-
play or to suppress. The control panel mirrors the
forensic encoding groupings described above, allow-
ing readers to display or suppress Motif Features,
Linguistic Features, and Edition Features as well as
Notes and Line Numbering, as shown at center in
Fig. 3.
While Fig. 3 shows the primary display interface,
Fig. 4, Example of motif comparison (in draft
form), provides an alternate display option, the abil-
ity to view the transformation of the motifs
described by <interpGrp> and <seg> (as explained
in Section 2.1 above), demonstrating how the XML
source, when transformed, enables readers to com-
pare the text of the motifs from Hafgeirs saga
Flateyings with the text of the motifs from
Ha´lfdanar saga Bro¨nufo´stra.
Fig. 5, Interactive display, demonstrates the user’s
ability to generate views of the semi-diplomatic
transcription, the edited transcription, or a combi-
nation of these.
While in Fig. 3 the control panel is configured
to display the ‘original’ (i.e. near-zero-level)
transcription of the text at the beginning of
Chapter One of Hafgeirs saga Flateyings, in Fig. 5,
the control panel is selected to display the ‘edited’
(i.e. regularized) transcription of the text at the
beginning of Chapter One. This interactive display

<add> (addition) Contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the text by an author, scribe, annotator, or
corrector.
<choice> Groups a number of alternative encodings for the same point in a text.
<corr> (correction) Contains the correct form of a passage apparently erroneous in the copy text.
<del> (deletion) Contains a letter, word, or passage deleted, marked as deleted, or otherwise indicated as
superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.
<expan> (expansion) Contains the expansion of an abbreviation.
<gap>6 Indicates a point where material has been omitted in a transcription, whether for editorial
reasons described in the TEI header, as part of sampling practice, or because the material is
illegible, invisible, or inaudible.
<orig> (original) Contains a reading which is marked as following the original, rather than being normalized
or corrected.
<reg> (regularization) Contains a reading which has been regularized or normalized in some sense.

can determine how they wish to view and interact
with the text and the interpretations of the text.

directions in digital philology. In doing so, it illus-
trates how P5 XML can be framed as a kind of
luminol that, when transformed, can be used to illu-
minate artefactual as well as literary, linguistic, and
transmission-level descriptions. In the specific case
of Hafgeirs saga Flateyings, my goal is identical to
that of a crime-scene investigator’s: Not necessarily
to solve the case, but to preserve and to present the
evidence.

Notes
1 While an anonymous reader has suggested the removal
of the descriptor ‘important’, pointing out that Hafgeirs
saga Flateyings is unlikely to rival most other
Icelandic sagas of its genre in terms of literary merit,
the importance of the text lies not in its literary con-
tribution—although it is arguably meritorious in its
own right—but, like any manuscript of the period, in
its representation of the scholarly milieu in Iceland and
Denmark at the time.
2 I added two motifs to Jorgensen’s original sequence:
GIRL_GIVES_GIFTS and FATHER_DIES.
3 Although I considered creating an edition from one of
the extant Ha´lfdanar saga Bro¨nufo´stra manuscripts, I
elected against doing so because the work is well-docu-
mented and widely available in print and electronic
editions. The text used for this edition is therefore
taken from Zoe Borovsky’s Norse Saga Home Page
(http://server.fhp.uoregon.edu/norse/), which provides
‘a digitized version of Guni Jo´nsson and Bjarni
Vilhja´lmsson’s three-volume popular edition of
Fornaldarso¨gur Norurlanda’ (Borovsky, 1998).
Because this Ha´lfdanar saga Bro¨nufo´stra version pro-
vides no chapter numberings, I assigned Chapter divi-
sions and page references based on Lbs. 3936, 4to, an
eighteenth-century paper manuscript of the text, avail-
able at Sagnanet (sagnanet.is). The saga is divided into
seventeen chapters, but the sequencing is 1–14; then
16–17. No chapter is numbered 15. Whether this is
an oversight of the scribe’s, a copying error, or other-
wise, is unclear. Lbs. 2121, 4to, another eighteenth-
century paper manuscript of the text, divides the saga
into twelve chapters. Like Lbs. 3936, 4to, Lbs. 2121, 4to
contains an apparently mis-numbered chapter
sequence: Chapter 3 is written twice (32v and 33r),
while no chapter is numbered chapter 4. This is note-
worthy given that Add. 6, fol. also contains what appear
to be chapter mis-numberings. For example, following
Chapter X, Chapter XII is written, though Chapter XI
is expected, and where Chapter XIV is expected,
only ‘Cap.’ is written. Though Jorgensen suggests
this is further evidence to support his forgery

commonplace.

6 The <gap> element is used to describe what appears to
be a lacuna; on leaf 52r (page 103) the scribe respon-
sible for Add 6, fol. uses a sequence of dots—or
puncts—apparently to mark seven of nine prose lines
as having been copied from an exemplar/original which
was corrupted and thus illegible, of particular interest
in the case of forgery if, as Jorgensen suggests, this
is a ‘non-linguistic’ effort to authenticate the text
(Jorgensen, 1977; p. 162).
