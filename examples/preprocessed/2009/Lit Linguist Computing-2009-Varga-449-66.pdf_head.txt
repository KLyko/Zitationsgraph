Abstract
Bilingual dictionaries are vital resources in many areas of natural language pro-
cessing. Numerous methods of machine translation require bilingual dictionaries
of large coverage, but less-frequent language pairs rarely have any digitalized
resources of such kind. Since the need for these resources is increasing, but the
human resources are scarce for less represented languages, efficient automatized
methods are imperative. This article presents a fully automated, robust interme-
diate language-based bilingual dictionary generation method that uses the
WordNet of the intermediate language to build a new bilingual dictionary. We
propose the usage of WordNet in order to increase accuracy; we also introduce a
bidirectional selection method with a flexible threshold to maximize recall. The
evaluations showed 79% accuracy and 51% weighted recall, outperforming rep-
resentative pivot language-based methods. A dictionary generated with this
method will still need manual post-editing, but the improved recall and precision
decrease the work of human correctors.
