Abstract
Given a collection of imperfect copies of a textual document, the aim of stem-
matology is to reconstruct the history of the text, indicating for each variant the
source text from it was copied. We describe an experiment involving three
artificial benchmark data sets to which a number of computer-assisted stemma-
tology methods were applied. Contrary to earlier similar experiments, we propose
and use a numerical criterion to evaluate all the solutions. Moreover, our primary
data set is significantly larger than used before. The results suggest the superiority
of two computer-assisted methods amongst those tested: the maximum
parsimony method implemented in the PAUP software package and a related
compression-based method we have proposed in earlier work.
