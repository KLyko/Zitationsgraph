Abstract
The work of the Shakespeare Clinic of Claremont McKenna College, led by Ward
E.Y. Elliott and Robert J. Valenza, is recognized for its pioneering computer
analysis of many early modern texts to determine whether William
Shakespeare (1564–1616) wrote the works traditionally ascribed to him. The
Clinic achieved its primary objective of eliminating all other known candidates
and thus confirming that Shakespeare wrote them. Two general methods of
analysis were applied to whole plays and variable-sized large texts: Discrete
Composite Analysis and Continuous Composite Analysis.. The first uses univari-
ate analysis to determine acceptance or rejection of forty-eight stylometric tests
for each text. The second uses a multi-dimensional composite mean for
Shakespeare derived from all forty-eight in order to determine acceptance or
rejection for each text. This article notes the omission of Discrete Analysis to
take into consideration statistical dependencies between the forty-eight tests, the
partly arbitrary ‘handfitting’ of acceptance–rejection boundaries for each of the
forty-eight tests, the failure to take into full account the factor of chronology, and
the absence of discussion of the part played by prior probabilities as to existing
beliefs concerning attribution. By this last point, I mean the role played by the
existing traditional consensus as to Shakespeare attribution, prior to linguistic
analysis. For Continuous Analysis, it is noted that the stated probabilities are not
true probabilities as acknowledged, and that the resulting acceptance–rejection
levels for them are calibrated in line with prior beliefs. Principal component
analysis is shown to give improved results in dealing with co-authored
Shakespeare plays, Henry VIII, Timon of Athens, and Pericles. This does not
invalidate the overall aim of the Shakespeare Clinic.
