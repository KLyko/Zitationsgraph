The task of attributing the plausible authorship of a
literary work resembles that of an art historian
anxious to find even the least salient traces in the
works of a plastic artist (either an architect,
a sculptor, a painter, or a designer), insofar as the
more the former knows about the latter, the more
connections will undoubtedly lead him/her to relate
work and author. The traditional methodology in
authorship attribution employs differences and
likenesses to ascertain the linguistic profile of the
author behind the curtain. However, the issue is not
that straightforward in non-traditional approaches
either, as these connections are often hard
to validate.
Lexical richness may be accepted as a point of
departure for identifying the stylistic idiosyncrasy
of an author and, hence, for authorship attribution
‘as they both (stylometrics and authorship attribu-
tion studies) share an interest in the size, coherence,
and distribution of the vocabularies of texts and
authors’ (Hoover, 2003). Most stylometric studies
are lexically based, especially because it is the level of
language where repetitions may be reliably used as
a basis for measurement (Holmes, 1994). In fact,

the language items of a work are assumed to entrap
both conscious and unconscious aspects of the
author’s style; it would then be an asset to find
the features of the unconscious aspect, since they
cannot be consciously manipulated by the author
(Laan, 1995).
The relevant literature reveals that divergent
opinions can be attested as regards the numerous
authorship attribution studies that, over the last
years, have tried to obtain the most faithful statistical
procedure, be the items morphological, syntactic, or
lexical. In particular, the validity of some techniques
employed in authorship attribution has been, to
some extent, questioned with the argument that
there is ‘no consensus on results, nor there is
consensus as to the accepted or correct methodology
or technique’, notwithstanding the persistent
‘wish for a single method of analysis and a verifiable
unique style’ (Rudman, 1998). For the state of the
art, we briefly review the contributions by Tweedy
and Baayen, Somers and Tweedy, Burrows, and
Hoover.
From a positive standpoint, Tweedie and Baayen
(1998) consider that textual similarities between and
within authors may become valid for authorship
attribution, as they seem to validate the empirical
trajectories of texts in the plane spanned by the
dimensions of lexical richness and lexical repetition,
providing thus a statistical technique for construct-
ing confidence intervals around them. In relation
to their experiment, Hoover (2003) points out that
the success greatly depends on the variety of texts
used (thematic and chronological), because the
results would have been radically different, had the
selection been also different. Actually, he is rather
sceptical about the possibility of relying on a one-to-
one connectedness between lexical richness and
authorship attribution and/or style description, on
account of the following words: ‘even though the
measures of vocabulary richness may be effective in
clustering texts by a same author, they cannot
provide a consistent, reliable, or satisfactory means
of identifying an author or describing a style’
(Hoover, 2003), to conclude that ‘the long-cherished
goal of the measure of vocabulary richness that
characterizes authors and their styles appears to be
unattainable. The basic assumption that underlies it
is false’. Somers and Tweedie (2003) also distinguish
a pastiche from the original by means of a
discriminating study based on word usage and lexical
richness. Lastly, Burrows’s Delta (2002; 2003) per-
forms rather successfully as the rate of unlikeness is
reliable for relating English Restoration poems, both
of known and unknown authors. The reliability
and effectiveness of Burrows’s Delta has been
assessed by Hoover (2004a) who, in turn, tests
successful modifications and alternatives to upgrade
the model.
For opportunity, we refer to Miranda and Calle’s
multivariate word and lemma-based study (2005a)
of the West Saxon Gospels (WSG), which was
accomplished to rank them in terms of lexical
richness measured by lemma-counting. The techni-
que has proven reliable in Old English texts (a
highly inflected language), as the same ordering of
works by lemma-counting in the main study,
namely Mt > Lk > Mk > Jn, is replicated in the
partitioning and the contrastive studies carried
out, and similar results are obtained by evaluating
Zipf ’s Z or the expression HL3/V(N)2.
The present research aims to replicate the above-
mentioned ranking of the WSG by using function
words (FW) in view of the consensus around
their greater reliability in stylometric studies
(Burrows, 2003) and their subsequent success for
authorship attribution. Therefore, our hypothesis is
grounded on the assumption that the particular
distribution of FW may constitute the salient
features which can identify an author’s style and
differentiate it from others. Three techniques are
experimented to check this hypothesis, and each of
them gives rise to each part of this article,
besides the Introduction and the methodological
procedure themselves. The first part deals with
the computation of functional density, the second
with the scoring of the most common function
lemmas (FL), and the third with the Delta-scoring of
the most common FW. To finish, some conclusions
are drawn, especially to indicate whether each
model (functional density, scoring of FL, and
Delta-scoring of FW) yields the same ranking,
or whether the types/tokens approach can be
complemented or optimized with studies based on
FL and/or FW.

2 Methodology
The field study comprises two different corpora as
well as two handling techniques. The computation
of functional density and the scoring of FL were done
with the annotated corpus containing the WSG and
the Old English Apollonius of Tyre (AoT) used in
Miranda and Calle (2005a). The benefits derived
from the annotation compensate for such a time-
consuming task, though it supposes ‘the regrettable
intrusion upon the data and avoids the interchange
of information with colleagues’ (Burrows, 2003),
or even ‘experimental corruption’ (Rudman, 1998).2
In the case of OE, unless you handle an annotated
text, you cannot distinguish between (1) vowel-
length minimal pairs when no length marker is
allocated, as ge¯ versus ge, fo¯r versus for, etc; (2)
homographs as þa¯ which may be nominative/
accusative plural of all genders of {se, se¯o, þæt},
accusative singular feminine of {se, se¯o, þæt}, adverb
of time, and/or conjunction of time.
The annotated corpus was then processed with
the Old English Concordancer (henceforth OEC)
(Miranda et al., 2006), which retrieves morpho-
syntactic, lexical, and statistical information, both
word- and lemma-based. Using this tool, all
the sorting and counting operations were per-
formed automatically, and the data were then
downloaded onto Excel spread-sheets to accomplish
the statistical study, and eventually plot the corres-
ponding figures.
The study of FW, however, required a huger
corpus for the sake of standardization, so a set of
archives from the Toronto Complete Corpus of Old
English Dictionary (Healey, 2000) was accordingly
processed by means of WordSmith Tools 3.0 (Scott,
1996). Leaving aside the matter of size, which
constitutes its main advantage, to cope with an
untagged corpus of Old English (henceforth OE)
is not free of intrusion either, in view of the
fact that you cannot automatically compute the
occurrences of allomorphs which are likely to be
taken as different words owing to (1) the alternative
employment of ‹þ›, ‹Þ›, ‹›, ‹Ð› in, for instance,
‹þa¯›, ‹Þa¯›, ‹a¯›, ‹oþþe›, ‹oÞe›, ‹oþe›, ‹oe›, etc;
(2) the existence of inter- and/or intradialectal
variants, such as ‹ange¯an›, ‹onge¯an›, ‹age¯an›, ‹hı¯›,
‹hı¯e›, ‹hig›, ‹hy¯›; and (3) the equivalence of ‹and›,
‹ond›, and the Tyronian nota, or of the forms
‹betwe¯onan›, ‹betwe¯onon›, ‹betweox›, ‹betwix›,
‹betwux›, ‹betwyx›.
To overcome these inconveniences, the results
generated by WordSmith Tools required further
replacement and grouping of the corresponding
allomorphs. As in the annotated corpus, the data
were also downloaded onto Excel spread-sheets for
their statistical analysis.
3 Functional Density: the Ratio of
Function Words to Content Words
The objective of this first study is to rank the WSG
by the ratio FW to content words (CW), which
requires to state what we understand by FW and
CW in the context of OE: the set of the latter is
assumed to comprise nouns, adjectives, verbs, and
adverbs of manner (mostly derived with the suffix
–(lı¯c)e, such as so¯þlı¯ce, witodlı¯ce, etc.), whereas the
set of the former is assumed to comprise the rest
(pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, interjec-
tions, and other-than-manner adverbs). Although
the line distributing adverbs into one set or another
looks blurred, our proposal seems the most
plausible insofar as only adverbs of manner ending
in –(lı¯c)e share their stems with CW and as
such they must be considered to belong to the
same open set.3 To help understand the scope
of the ratio FW/CW, let us compare it with other
common related expressions, namely: (word-based)
lexical richness¼V/N, (lemma-based) lexical
richness¼ L/N, inflectional diversity (V/L), etc.,
in the following examples. Examples (1) and (2)
illustrate two purposely created eight-word sen-
tences, examples (3)–(7) contain each of the
sentences of a real abstract, and (8) the whole
abstract (see Note 4 for the text and reference).
That that that that student used was wrong. (1)
False friends lead foreign students to make
mistakes. (2)
First, the occurrences are counted and the results
tabulated as in Table 1.
Next, the expressions are computed and their
results illustrated in Table 2.

In view of the results, it seems obvious that (2) is
lexically richer than (1), whilst the latter happens
to be denser than the former in functional terms.
It goes without saying that V/N (Mendenhall’s
formula) and L/N (the corresponding expression in
terms of lemmas) are not reliable for comparison
unless the same N is involved, since they are text-
length dependent as the relevant literature shows
(Tweedy and Baayen, 1998).5
The maximum value for V/N and for L/N (2, 4)
is the unity, although the average is less than one,
L/N being always equal or less than V/N. In contrast,
when V and L are rated to calculate the inflectional
diversity (i.e. the average of word-forms per lemma),
its minimum value is the unity, which is bound to
increase in highly inflected languages such as Latin,
OE, or Modern German. In an intermediate
position, the ratio FW/CW ranges from below the
unity to over one, likely to provide a greater
discriminating power, which the other expressions
cannot confer: when N is the same in some texts
(1, 2) and (5, 6) and, therefore, no text-length
dependency can be invoked, functional density can
distinguish between them whereas the other ratios
cannot. This observation made us consider the
convenience of testing its reliability. In analogy to
lexical density, which is undoubtedly bound
to imply either lexical richness (V/N) or the ratio
CW/N, we will henceforth adopt the term
functional density to refer to the ratio FW/CW,
avoiding thus any kind of likely terminological
misunderstanding.
Once the discriminating power of functional
density has been introduced, we need to determine
the values of FW and CW in the works of the corpus
to evaluate the functional density. For this purpose,
N is first counted in terms of class (Table 3);
then adverbs are sorted into manner and
other-than-manner adverbs by means of the OEC
(Table 4); and lastly the ratio is obtained (Table 5).

With the values for functional density, the WSG
are ranked in decreasing order as follows:
Jn > Mk > Lk > Mt > AoT
where Jn (Mk preceding) is ranked as having the
greatest functional density and, conversely, AoT
(Mt preceding) is ranked as having the lowest
functional density, which proves our hypothesis of
relating the ranking of the WSG by functional density
as the inverse of the one by lexical richness
(Miranda and Calle, 2005a), as follows:
AoT > Mt > Lk > Mk > Jn
This proof confirms the reliability of FW as salient
features in authorship attribution tasks as we have
been successful in opposing Jn against Mt, as having
the highest inflectional density and the highest lexical
richness, respectively; and conversely, Mt and Jn as
having the lowest inflectional density and the highest
lexical richness. In other words, we could somewhat
oppose inflectional density against lexical richness
without considering the latter as being actually the
inverse of the former due to the different scope of
the parameters applied: whereas all members of V
and L are included in N (inclusion), all members of
CW are excluded from FW (exclusion).
4 Score of Function Lemmas
Unlike functional density, whose computation
requires to tabulate the whole set of CW and FW,
the scoring of FL only takes into account the
occurrences of the most common ones. This study
is based on lemmas for the convenience of
having homographs regularized, allomorphs
grouped together, verb forms, and pronominal
forms linked under the corresponding lemma,
be they personal, demonstrative, or possessive. For
this reason, the same annotated corpus is used
and the seventy-eight topmost common FL are
chosen from the union set {Jn, Lk, Mk, Mt, AoT},
as listed in Table 6.
As expected, the ordering of FL by absolute or
relative frequency does differ slightly from one
work to another, the differences becoming greater
between Jn, on the one hand, and Lk, Mk, Mt, on
the other, even in the three topmost FL (see and,
he¯, se, etc.). Therefore, to count on another
reliable technique of ranking by means of FL, we
resort to find out the difference between the
relative frequency of each FL in each text and its
frequency in the union set, which is taken as an
ideal corpus on the assumption that their
distribution and repetition rate is the standard.
In other words, the greater the deviation found in
a given text to the standard (which implies
more occurrences of FL than in the ideal
corpus), the less rich it will be in lexical terms
and, conversely, the smaller the deviation found in
a literary work, the richer it will be from a lexical
point of view.
The calculation procedure is explained stepwise,
as follows. First, we score each FL in each of the
WSG and in AoT (i.e. as the percentage resulting
from frequencies/N). Second, we score each FL in the
ideal corpus, constituted by the union set {Jn, Lk,
Mk, Mt, AoT} (i.e. also as the percentage of the
total of lemma frequencies/N total, rather than as
the mean of the individual percentages). Next, we
subtract the score of each FL in each work to the
score of each item in the ideal corpus. Fourth,
we add up the absolute values of the differences
in each text and divide the result by the number
of function lemmas employed (78), as shown in
Table 7 and fifth, we rank the texts in decreasing
order, either by the sum or by the quotient, as
follows:
Mt < Lk < Mk < Jn < AoT

In view of the ranking, we can state that Mt is the
least unlike the ideal corpus, which is also applicable
to Lk (second after Mt), and so on till AoT, which
ranks as the most unlike. Recalling that the WSG are
ranked as Mt > Lk > Mk > Jn in terms of lexical
richness, we must admit that our hypothesis holds
for the ranking of the WSG, whose order is as
expected, and the discriminating value of the scoring
of FL might be accepted in a near future if other
authorship attribution studies validate its general
reliability. In this particular case, some arguments
may question its validity. One has to do with the
limited size of the ideal corpus, which might be
criticized as not being wholly representative, and the
other can be established in the sense that the level
of (dis)similitude with respect to the ideal corpus
derives from the nature of its origin: the union of the
constituent subsets. Therefore, to rule out any
randomness, the technique must be experimented
with larger corpora in English (Middle, Modern, or
Contemporary) with the inherent inconvenience of
their annotation.
5 Delta-score of Function Words
In this third study, we attempt to check the
hypothesis again by testing the Delta model, and,
to gain accuracy, the annotated corpus (77,170
tokens) used in Sections 3 and 4 is replaced with
a raw corpus (934,719 tokens, approximately
one-fourth of the whole OE extant production)
where lemmas are replaced by word-types, arresting
thus the comparison and exchange of frequencies.6
This corpus (henceforth entire corpus) is formed by
representative prose works (838,795 tokens) and
a selection of poetry (95,924 tokens). The latter is
included to compensate for any likely overweighting
influence of the prose works selected, which are
either authored or anonymous, some of which are
translations from Latin.7
First, a frequency hierarchy for FW is
established (Table 8) to contain the 108 topmost
common FW, ending with those words that
occur 3 times in every 2,000. Their frequencies,
which result as the sum of susceptible individual
function words, that is, ‹and›, ‹þa›, ‹þæt/þat›,
‹on›, ‹he›, ‹þe/þec›, etc., regardless of context,
amount to 440,112 tokens (47.084%) of the entire
corpus, after having skipped over 57,107 tokens,
which are related to CW.8 The homographs are
not tagged.9
Out of the works of the entire corpus, we
select some for the main and others for the
test corpus, taking into account that the main
objective is to find out the level of (un)likeness
between pairs of related works from each corpus.
Thus, Jn and Mt, being the most unlike,
are included in the main corpus, whereas Lk and
Mk will be used in the test corpus. Also with
a similar criterion, works by the same author
(Ælfric) or similar versions of the same work (the
Benedictine Rule for monks and for nuns) are
assigned to each corpus to check their level of
(un)likeness, thus following Hoover’s suggestion
of using works of known authorship to test the
efficiency of Delta (Hoover, 2004b). The other
works are included to serve as dummies.
Accordingly, the distribution of works in each
corpus is shown in Table 9, and the occurrences
of each FW in the hierarchy are counted and added
up (
P
). For space, only the total values are
provided along with the ratio FW/N, the mean
(), and the standard deviation ().
The procedure for calculation of Burrows’s
Delta (2003) is described stepwise, as follows.
First, we score each FW in each work, as well as in
the main corpus, where the scores are given as
percentages of the frequencies of each FW to
the total word-count (N), so that the larger do not
exert an undue influence. In addition, we calculate
 and  in the main corpus, as indicated in Table 10,
which contains, in descending order, the values for
the thirty-six top FW in Jn, Mt, VRS, BenR, Æhom1,
Whom, and ÆCHom2, though the list expands
downwards for 108 FW. Thus, for and,  is
5.016501463, and  is 1.602026783, respectively,
and the score for Jn is 5.573751316, for Mt is
6.963542941, and so on. The scores result
from rating the occurrences of such FW to N: in
the case of Jn, and¼ 953 and N¼ 17.098. For
space, the scores of only six works are included in
the table.
Second, we calculate the z-score of each FW by
subtracting its score in each work from  in the

main corpus, and dividing the result by , as shown
in Table 11. Thus, the z-score for and in Jn is
0.347840533, which derives from the referred
expression. For space, the z-scores of only six
works are included in the table.
Third, we calculate the difference between the
z-score of each FW in the main corpus and that
of each work in the test corpus. Then, we obtain
the Delta-score by adding the absolute values of the
differences obtained, and dividing the result by
the number of FW.
Fourth, we rank each work in the test corpus
according to Delta values, in such a way that the
smaller the value, the least unlike it will become to
the work of the main corpus under scrutiny. For the
sake of clarity, we summarize all the values of Delta,
along with those of  and  in Table 12. To the
right of the values for Delta-score, the ones for
Delta-z-score are also included.
From the analysis of the values for Delta in the
table, two main facts must be highlighted inasmuch
as they seem to validate both points of our

hypothesis: (1) to confirm the level of (un)likeness
among the WSG, as conjectured; (2) to relate works
by the same author, as expected. With respect to (1),
Luke’s study evinces that Mt is the least unlike to Lk,
whereas Jn is the second. Analogously, Mark’s study
shows that Mt is also the most like to Mk, whereas
Jn is also the second. In addition, Mt and Lk look
like each other the most. From these results the
WSG can be ranked in terms of Delta the same way
as by lexical richness, that is, Mt > Lk > Mk > Jn.
With respect to (2), our analysis is restricted to
ÆCHom1, Ælet, and BenR, whose association
with works in the main corpus was evident, and
the results confirm the proof clearly: ÆCHom2 and
Æhom1 are the least unlike to ÆCHom1; Æhom1
and ÆCHom2 are the least unlike to ÆLet;
and BenRW is the least unlike to BenR. However,
it is worth pointing the likeness observed by
Whom with respect to Ælfric’s works as well as
by Or with respect to the latter and BenR. Following
the scholarly suggestion of an anonymous reviewer,
the Delta study was repeated by replacing Mt
in the main corpus alternatively by Lk and Mk,
and Jn by Lk and Mk, and Lk and Mk by Mt and
Jn in the test corpus to gain reliability with the
results of the six possible combinations of Jn, Lk,
Mk, and Mt. For clarity, only the results of the
Gospels, Ælfric’s works, and BenR are included in
Table 13, and for space some decimals have been
suppressed.
As the results do not require a further
interpretation, their values haven been plotted to
ease their comparison and to help draw some
conclusions (Fig. 1).
It is true that we have used the Delta technique
for our purposes, though with scientific rigour and,
in light of this, we must join Hoover in recognizing
the excellence of the methodology proposed by
Burrows, as it proves to operate efficiently and
reliably. In this line, Hoover’s detailed and (pro-
spective) publications on Delta have encouraged us
to check one of his proposals, in particular, the
modification of the range of MCW to be considered
and/or the possibility of eliminating pronouns from
the counting, etc. Thus, when the values for Delta
proved their efficiency for our study, we repeated
the experiment in four ways, that is, leaving out (1)
the topmost common FW (in number of 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, 60, 70, 80); (2) the bottommost common FW
(in number of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80); (3)
the top and bottommost common FW (in number
of 10, 20); and (4) all personal pronouns and
possessives (he¯, his, hı¯, him, ic, we¯, þu¯, hine, hit,
heora, he¯o, u¯s, me¯, e¯ow, u¯re, hire, mı¯n, hira).
Although no homogeneous result can be expected,
there is one constant common to all of them: the
replication of the firstly ranked like work. In
addition to this, more likenesses are observed
in some of the variants experimented on test
works, as shown in Table 14.

These results serve to confirm the validity of
Delta, independent of the range of frequency
adopted without enlarging the initial scope of 108
function words, at least for the particular cases
investigated.
6 Conclusions
We have proven, out of any reasonable doubt, both
by lemma-counting and by Zipf ’s Z, that the lexical
richness of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew
is greater than that of the other three, which
leads to the following ranking: Mt > Lk > Mk > Jn
(Miranda and Calle, 2005a). The inverse ranking
Jn > Lk > Mk > Mt (resembling a mirror image of the
previous one) has been obtained by means of
functional density. The same ranking has also been
generated from the study of FL, and the values for
Delta-score and Delta-z-score also point to this
direction insofar as Mt and Lk are estimated as the
least unlike whereas Mt and Jn were taken as
the most unlike. From these results, it follows that
the four works can be equally ranked in terms of
functional density or by means of lemma-scoring
and successfully clustered, thanks to Delta-score.

Therefore, it is worth enhancing their complemen-
tary feature for tasks of ranking and clustering in
authorship attribution studies.
The efficiency of functional density has been
proven as an indirect measure to rank texts in terms
of lexical richness from the least rich to the most, the
ranking obtained being similar to the one resulting
by means of Z; in other words, functional density
may be a helpful marker to relate works by the same
author, once the technique has been refined and
tested with larger corpora. An in-progress research
based on an annotated corpus of the Federalist
Papers seems to reveal traces confirming the validity
of functional density in the attribution of authorship

of these 18th-century American English texts. After
having handled the Disputed Papers and a significant
part of the undisputed contributions (all by Jay, and
by Madison, and some by Hamilton), the computa-
tion of functional density points to the fact that
Madison’s and the Disputed Papers are the least
unlike, as is generally acknowledged (Mosteller and
Wallace, 1984). However, the application of func-
tional density has to overcome the difficulties
deriving from the requirement of an annotated
corpus and an appropriate concordancer.
Likewise, the use of the top FL has proven to
measure the divergence from an ideal corpus as an
indirect technique to ascertain lexical richness. The

technique may be helpful at least to signal the main
tendency, but its accuracy depends on the avail-
ability of a large annotated corpus to avert the
problems of text-length dependency.
Lastly, Burrows’s methodology has been success-
fully tested as Delta was able to cluster the pairs
of gospels under experiment as the most (un)like
as well as to associate works by the same
author. Considering that our aim was to corrobo-
rate what we already knew: (1) the ranking of
the WSG by lexical richness (by lemma-counting and
by Z) and (2) the leading candidates in the case
of Aelfric’s works (Homilies and Letters) and of
the Benedict Rule, the hypothesis also holds true in
both cases. Besides, Hoover’s proposal for top
and/or bottom truncation, and/or for neglecting
pronominals has been successfully tested.
From experience, we must highlight the simplicity
of the procedure of accounting only FW, although
it would be useful to check whether similar results
can be obtained by applying Delta methodology
to the hierarchies of the whole works or to
their corresponding partitions (for example, of
3,000 words). In this line, we cannot help
insisting on the suitability of FW in quantitative
studies (Craig, 1999), irrespective of the aims
pursued. Several facts will be argued to support
our statement. One is quantitatively featured as
their suitability is given by the weight within
the text: only the frequencies of the top 108
most common FW range from 48.1398% in the
main corpus to 50.4861% of the test corpus (i),
the ratio FW to CW (functional density) ranges
from 1.134867033 in AoT to 1.320108696 in
Jn (ii). The other is qualitatively featured as the
distribution of their use can certainly describe the
style of an author.
Before closing this section, some lines are to
be devoted to the nature of the works which
bear this study: the translation of the Holy Gospels
into West Saxon (henceforth WS), the most
prestigious dialect of OE. It is necessary to insist
on the word translation because it is an actual
rendering from a Latin source rather than a gloss
(unlike the cases of the Lindisfarne Gospels, written
in the Northumbrian dialect, or of the Mercian
Rushworth). Without assessing the quality of the
version (not free of mistakes!), we must admit that
all the evidences found in our study signal the
common lexical similarities of the so-called
Synoptic Gospels since Mt and Lk are supposed to
have their common textual source in Mk, but these
likenesses are not so markedly significant and
regularly distributed as to counterbalance the
differences that can serve to put them apart.
Previous to this research, we accomplished a
comparative lexical study between the Latin source
and the WS renderings of the Gospels, by comput-
ing N, V, MFW, HL, HD, K and Z to conclude
that, in general terms, the data concerning each
WS gospel resembled its Latin counterpart: both
are ranked as Mk > Lk > Mt > Jn, if Yule’s K is
applied, and as Mt > Lk > Mk > Jn, if Zipf’s Z
is applied. Obviously, the WS texts are numerically
greater than the Latin ones, as the latter relies on
a more synthetic system than OE. In fact, the
ratio N(WS) to N(L) ranges from 10.63 in Lk
to 11.16 in Mt. The reason for this numerical
difference in N must be associated with the
unbalanced use of certain FW in each language:
demonstratives (acting as determiners) are more
common in OE, personal pronouns acting
as subjects are usually omitted in Latin, and
prepositions are more than once unnecessary in
Latin due to its stronger casual system. Therefore,
the weight of FW within N differs from one
language to another, which makes them reliable
enough for authorship difference. Despite the
low value of N, the widely known The Lord’s
Prayer can illustrate our argument better, as shown
in Table 15 (de la Cruz et al., 2003).
As can be observed, the difference is not too
sharp due to the fact that the imperative is the most
common tense used and, therefore, the pronominal
subject can be omitted in both. Text-length N is
expected to increase with decreasing level of
synthesis, as happens when two other prayers in
Latin are compared with their versions in
Contemporary English (Table 16).
All in all, the data concerning the FW used in
Latin are bound to offer such significant variations
with respect to their WS counterparts that it would
be daring to state that their distribution is alike in
both versions. Add to this the differences observed

in the translation of Latin absolute ablatives and/or
the rendering of amen, autem, vero, etc. into OE.
Therefore, we estimate that the WS Gospels,
notwithstanding their condition of translated
pieces, can be the object of an independent study
of authorship, and in view of the evidences found
in the use of FW we can even dare to affirm
that the translatorship of The Gospel according to
Saint Matthew and that of Saint John cannot be
assigned to the same person, as Liuzza (2000)
proposes. Furthermore, the features distinguishing
between Mt and Jn cannot be necessarily
attributed to their inclusion within or exclusion
from the Synoptic Gospels, but rather to the
different usage of FW, which amounts to 50% of
N as an average.

2 The annotation was accomplished as follows. First,
the corpus was typed using the TT font Fonetik
for special characters and vowel length markers.
Second, it was tagged by MAOET (standing for
Morphological Analyser of Old English Texts;
see Miranda, Trivin˜o, and Calle 2000: 127–45), which
provides all the possible tags for each word, regardless
of context, including lemma, morphological analysis
(class, type, case, gender, number, etc.),
and meaning(s). Third, it was semi-automatically
disambiguated according to context by means of an
ad hoc tool.
3 Even with a clear-cut definition, the subjectivity of the
disambiguator cannot be ruled out because some
examples admit more than one plausible tagging.
4 John F. Burrows has proposed Delta, a simple new
measure of textual difference, as a tool for authorship
attribution and has shown that it has great potential,
especially in attribution problems, where the possible
authors are numerous and difficult to limit by
traditional methods (3). In tests on prose, Delta has
performed nearly as well as for Burrows’s verse texts
(4). A series of further tests using automated methods,
however, shows that two modified methods of
calculating Delta and three alternatives to or trans-
formations of Delta produce results that are even
more accurate (5). Four of these five new measures
produce much better results than Delta both on a
very diverse group of 104 novels and on a group of
forty-four smaller contemporary literary critical texts
(6). Although further testing is needed,
Delta and its modifications should prove valuable
and effective tools for authorship attribution
(7) (Hoover, 2004a).
