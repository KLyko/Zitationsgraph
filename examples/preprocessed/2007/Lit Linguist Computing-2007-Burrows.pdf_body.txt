Computational stylistics deals in patterns derived
from the relative frequencies of many words across
a chosen range of texts. In recent years, much
attention has been given, in this area of scholarly
inquiry, to the words that occur most often. These,
of course, are words that every writer of English will
call upon in almost any form of written expression.
We now know that there are strong concomitant
variations of frequency among many of these words.
The consistency of the variations is usually sufficient
to bear the weight of statistical analysis. This makes
it possible, among other things, to distinguish the
writings of different authors from each other and,
accordingly, to test the authorship of doubtful texts.
Such idiosyncratic patterns of occurrence in the
top stratum of frequency are scarcely apparent to
a reader. A given writer’s habitual choices among
comparatively rare words, on the other hand,
are easily seen, often attract comment, and lend
themselves to parody. In the large area between the
extremes of ubiquity and rarity, it is also possible to
identify many words (not all of them unusual) that
a given writer employs with some consistency while
most others do not. Now if, in comparable bodies of
work, some writers use certain words that others do
not—and the more so if those words recur—it
seems fair to suppose that the users are the most
likely to employ them in new specimens of their
work. It would follow that each writer’s use of such
words might yield a distinctive profile.
If the words that make up the second and third
of these frequency strata are to yield evidence
of authorship, appropriate statistical procedures
must be brought to bear. In the third stratum,
the inherent fragility of low-frequency statistics is
made worse, in our field of inquiry, by a tendency to
focus on words not used by anyone except the
target-author. The presence of such words in a given

text can undoubtedly be of evidential value. Their
absence may easily be adventitious. And they are
usually too few to bear much weight statistically.
It is nevertheless possible, as I hope to show, to
support (not displace) this form of evidence by
relaxing one’s stipulations and adding words that
few (rather than no) others use. The evidential
power of each word is thus reduced but there is
more room for a cumulative effect.
In studies of putative authorship, the middle
frequency stratum has scarcely been addressed. A
body of words, most of them lexical, that we take up
and discard according to the needs of a topic or
an occasion does not seem likely to offer useful
evidence of authorship. Among these words, how-
ever, there are many that respond to simple rules
of consistency and contrast. Once the words that
almost everybody uses are excluded, it is possible to
identify words that many writers seldom use but
that recur, with some consistency, in a wide-ranging
set of work by a given author. Not all of them will
reappear in everything that he or she writes; but it
seems that more of them can be expected here than
in the work of other writers.
Statistical tests directed at each of the three strata
are proving extremely accurate in identifying the
true author of authentic texts 2,000 words or more
in length. The level of accuracy gradually falls away
with shorter texts. The errors that do arise, even
with longer texts, differ from stratum to stratum.
The evidence of the most frequent words can be
distorted when an author makes an uncharacteristic
choice of genre or literary form, as when Henry
Fielding turns his hand to verse. The evidence
of the middle range of words can be distorted by
a radically different choice of subject, as when
Aphra Behn turns her mind from love to death.
The evidence of the unusual words is susceptible to
aberration as when circumstance carries a particular
word into a little flurry of occurrences. Some
judicious culling of the word-list alleviates these
difficulties. But, while the tests are still being
developed, it is better not to interfere with the
evidence.
Since there need be no overlapping among the
words tested in each stratum, it might appear that
the three sorts of test are independent of each other.
While that is an important part-truth, it is offset,
to an extent we do not much understand, by
innumerable links, overt and covert, among the
occurrence-rates of different words. An emphasis on
the feminine, for example, is to be observed at every
level of the vocabulary of most female writers. It is
present again, in an altered guise, in the vocabulary
of Rochester’s literary circle. Despite this restriction
of their apparent independence, a concurrence in
the test-results from the different strata clearly
strengthens a given outcome.
Why should such tests work as accurately and
reliably as they do? Provided they are properly used,
the proper answer, I believe, is ‘How could it be
otherwise?’ Any writer’s vocabulary is a selection
from the full resources of a given language as used
at that time. His or her preferences will reflect such
differentiae as level of education, gender, chosen
audience, topics of customary choice, and so on.
If it is an international language like English, there
will be signs of a given national variety. The writer’s
preferences will also reflect idiosyncrasies too subtle
for such broad categories. Such a set of preferences
will amount, in short, to one major facet of a
Saussurian parole, drawn from the larger resources
of the langue itself. As such, like every other
meaningful aspect of our behaviour, they will
display not only an underlying likeness, greater or
lesser, to our various fellows but also our differences
from them. Whether that line of thought is an
incipient theory or merely an idea of a certain
generality, I am too simple an empiricist to judge.
I note, however, that de Saussure’s distinction is
acceptable to Chomsky, whose distinction between
‘competence’ and ‘performance’ is germane. That,
I take it, should put it in good standing among
adherents of the high-priori sort of language study.
Yet, even if de Saussure were denied that privilege,
one might still do worse than follow him and bring
a little further evidence to show that (in written as
well as spoken language) his distinction is as useful
as it is plausible.
Let me put it boldly in the form of a postulate.
Evidence of authorship pervades whatever anybody
writes. Provided appropriate procedures are
employed in the analysis of an appropriate set of
texts, it can almost always be elicited. It is inherent,

however, not merely in statistical principle but in
human behaviour at large, that such evidence
cannot be absolute. The consistencies we observe
are trends, not universals. Our many stabilities are
offset by our capacity for change.
2 Texts to be Assessed
Some of the procedures to be described here are
new and need extensive testing. For the more
limited purposes of this introductory sketch,
the putative authorship of eight poems of the
English Restoration era will be assessed. Three are
of unquestioned authorship. These are Edmund
Waller’s ‘On the Danger his Majesty (being Prince)
Escaped’ and ‘Instructions to a Painter’ and Andrew
Marvell’s ‘The First Anniversary of the Government
under O. C.’ The other five poems are rejoinders
to Waller’s ‘Instructions,’ political satires treating
harshly of James, Duke of York (Waller’s hero of the
moment) and the conduct of naval affairs.
Presumably because an author of such work might
well be tried for treason, all five were published
anonymously and their authorship is still not
definitely known. But the ‘Last Instructions to a
Painter’ is accepted as Marvell’s. Current scholarly
opinion, as reflected in the most recent edition of
Marvell’s poetry (Smith, 2003) favours him as
author of the ‘Second’ and the ‘Third Advice to a
Painter.’ (See also Patterson, 2000.) The authorship
of the ‘Fourth’ and ‘Fifth’ remains open but the idea
that they may be Marvell’s has no support.1 The case
is set out more fully in a recent article (Burrows,
2005), where the evidence of the very common
words is brought to bear. The series of tests
undertaken below begins with a specimen of the
results offered by the very common words.
These eight poems have particular advantages
for assessing the effectiveness of tests directed at the
less common words. As to Waller, the experiment
is fairly straightforward. Two of the eight poems
are his, one is not, and the other five cannot be.
All eight treat subjects that he favours and (though
some are hostile) in a manner broadly related to his.
As to Marvell, the matter is more difficult because
these political poems stand well apart from most of
his acknowledged work. Yet the question is worth
asking. Can the tests we shall be examining offer
results that accord with scholarly opinion? That
would entail an outcome in which the poem known
to be Marvell’s and the three considered his were
distinguished from the two by Waller and the two
by unidentified poets. When the proposed contest
between Waller and Marvell is resolved, we shall
consider whether the authorship of these poems can
also be established in a contest where many other
poets of the period are introduced.
For some of the necessary comparisons, I have
had recourse to a large and diverse database of half
a million words of Restoration poetry.2 A further
forty-one independent texts have also been intro-
duced. Twenty-one are poems (or long excerpts
from poems) by authors included in the main
database. The remaining twenty are by Restoration
poets who are not members of the main set.3
All the texts have been modernized to over-
come the vagaries of seventeenth-century spelling.
Contractions like ‘I’ll’ and ‘don’t’ have been
expanded. A few words are tagged so as to
distinguish among their main grammatical
functions.
3 The Evidence of very Common
Words: The Delta Test
In the multivariate statistical procedures used to
elicit intelligible patterns in the frequency-
distribution of the very common words, the texts
are specimens and the words are the variables under
scrutiny. To allow for differences in length between
text and text, the raw frequencies for each word-
type are standardized, usually as percentages of all
the word-tokens in each text.4 The standardized
frequencies are arranged in descending order as a
frequency-profile for each text in turn.
The Delta procedure compares the upper range
of the frequency-profile of a given text with those
of many authors and shows which of them is
least unlike it. The operation of the procedure
is described elsewhere and a large body of results
is shown. (Burrows, 2002, 2003; Hoover, 2004)5.
Especially with texts of more than 2,000 words,
the results point towards the more likely candidates
and allow the elimination of the more unlikely.
The errors that occur from time to time stem from

Authorship in Different Frequency Strata
unusually strong changes in an author’s style, as
between the early and the late work of Cowley;
as between the satires and the lyrics of Robert
Gould; or as when a gifted translator like
Dryden submerges many of his usual stylistic
propensities as he tries to catch the spirit of his
foreign model.
The outcome of each Delta test stands free of
all the others in the sense that each specimen text,
in turn, is matched against the same collection
of authorial sets. If those sets are changed, the
various specimens are all affected; but, in contrast to
other procedures like cluster analysis and principal
component analysis, the specimens tested do not
affect each other.
A ‘delta-score’, like those shown under that
heading in Table 1, can be defined as ‘the mean of
the absolute differences between the z-scores for a
set of word-variables in a given text-group and
the z-scores for the same set of word-variables in a
target text’. When they are calculated, as here, for a
sufficient number of authors, they can be ranked
and ‘delta z-scores’ can be derived to allow more
meaningful comparisons among the results for
different texts.6
Table 1 shows that Waller and Marvell, respec-
tively, rank first of the twenty-five authors for each
of the three unquestioned poems. Marvell also ranks
first for the ‘Last Instructions’ and for the ‘Second’
and the ‘Third Advice’. Almost all the scores are
strong enough to bear real weight and at no point is
there a close contest between Waller and Marvell.
Marvell, so it proves, ranks well down the list of
twenty-five for the two ‘Advices’ thought not to be
his work. Robert Gould, much too young to be a
contender, ranks first for the ‘Fourth Advice’,
followed by Denham, whose claim can be taken
seriously. As for the ‘Fifth Advice’, a close contest
among several unlikely candidates is a typical result
in cases where the true author lies outside our group
of twenty-five. The weak delta z-scores at the head
of the list also support that possibility. Table 1, in
short, is a fair specimen of the evidence in the article
mentioned (Burrows, 2005) and the results are
entirely in keeping with current literary scholarship.
Taking all this as our basis, we can go on to consider
two new approaches to such matters.
4 The Evidence of Less Common
Words: The Zeta and Iota Tests
4.1 One on one: Waller versus
Marvell; Marvell versus Waller
The Delta procedure focuses on a text and seeks to
identify the correct one of many possible authors.
The new ‘Zeta’ and ‘Iota’ tests, on which I have been
working in recent months, focus on a single author
and seek to identify which of many texts are most
likely to be his or hers. The point of departure for
this series of tests is the complete word-list for a
large sample of a particular author’s work. The
13,838 word-tokens of the Waller set used here
embrace 2,876 distinct word-types. (The 20,151 of
Marvell embrace 4,323.) Corresponding lists are
then established and tabulated, showing the inci-
dence of these same word-types in each of the other
members of a large group of authorial sets and also
in such independent texts as are to be assessed. In
my experiments to date, around 10,000 word-tokens
seem to suffice as a reliable minimum for an
authorial set, 500 (but preferably many more) for an
independent text.
The tests rest upon stipulated contrasts between
a base-set (the main sample of the current target-
author) and a counter-set (comprising one or more
of the remaining authorial samples). Table 2, a tiny
Microsoft Excel worksheet, offers a concise but
limited model of the procedure. The hierarchical
array of word-types shown in Columns F and G
runs down as usual from ‘the’ and ‘and’. Their
incidence in Waller, the base-set for this first series,
is shown in Column I. In Columns A to E, the
Waller set is broken into five segments of almost
equal size, with the remainder added to segment
five, increasing it from 2,767 to 2,770. The figures in
Column H indicate how many of the five segments
contain each word and run down, accordingly, from
5 to 1. This makes a simple measure of Waller’s
consistency in the use of each word-type in turn.
(Even in the present list of extremely common
words, ‘your’ appears in only three of the five
segments. In the full list of 2,876 word-types,
of course, 1 is much the most common count.)
Column J and K treat of the chosen counter-set, the
main set of Marvell. Column J shows which of the

word-types actually occur in Column K, the list of
scores for Marvell’s main set. (Registering only 1
here and only 1 or 0 in the full list, Column J serves
little purpose until we turn to multi-author
counter-sets.) The remaining four columns, L
to O, show corresponding scores for four of the
chosen texts. The separation between ‘trial-pieces’
and ‘test-pieces’ allows the specimens actually at
issue to be held aside until the desired trial-runs are
complete and a set of stipulations appropriate to the
particular case has been determined. It is good
practice, obviously, not even to introduce the test-
pieces until that stage of proceedings. In the present
article, however, the distinction between ‘trial-
pieces’ and ‘test-pieces’ is inoperative because the
same few stipulations will be used throughout.
The overall results are shown in Rows 4 to 6 and
8 to 10. Rows 4 to 6 treat word-types. Row 4 shows
the sum of occurrences in each text-specimen of
whatever word-types are listed in column G. Row 5
shows the length of each specimen. Row 6 registers
the number of word-types as a rate per thousand of
the corresponding entry in Row 5. Rows 8 to 10
treat the sum-total of word-tokens in the same
fashion. In column D, for example, 19 of the 20
types shown in column G occur in this segment; and
these 19 types occur a total of 792 times, which is a
rate of 286.23 per thousand.
With texts of uniform length—segments of plays
or novels, for example—the relative occurrence-
rates of the word-types are a valuable differentia.7
But, as has often been observed, the type/token ratio
is much affected by text-length. With texts of
different length, like a group of poems, the
occurrence-rate of the word-tokens themselves is
a more useful measure. Even in the miniature
example of Table 2, the occurrence-rates of the three
Waller entries exceed those for the three associated
with Marvell. But the gap between the lowest Waller
and the highest Marvell—273.07 against 267.78 per
thousand—is too narrow to be convincing. A more
stringent approach is needed.
The stipulated contrasts between base-set and
counter-set are the heart of the affair. In the simple
form shown in Table 2, the only operative criterion
is reflected in the descending order of Waller’s
scores in Column I. The fact that this is Waller’s
word-list, not Marvell’s, is evident in the many
perturbations of rank-order in Column K. But the
comparatively weak distinctions shown in Row 10
need to be strengthened and controlled.
If all the data in the full work-sheet for Waller,
from Row 12 down to Row 2,887, are sorted on the
basis of the counts in Column H, it is possible to
discard all those word-types that do not meet a
stipulated level of consistency across the five
segments of the main Waller-set as represented in
Columns A to E. If the remaining data are then
sorted on the basis of Column K, it is possible to
discard all those word-types that exceed a specified
level of frequency in Marvell. If the stipulations are
too weak, no consistent authorial difference will
emerge. But if they are too strict, the surviving
word-list can be too impoverished to yield a reliable
outcome.
Table 3 shows the outcome of tests in which
Waller and Marvell are opposed. In the top half of
the table, Waller provides the base-set, Marvell
the counter-set. In the bottom half, their roles are
reversed. In each half of the table, we open the series
with a simple overview. Beyond the fact that these
are the words of one or other of the two opposed
authorial sets, no further stipulation is imposed.
In both overviews, the occurrence-rate for the
chosen base-set is, by definition, 1,000 per 1,000.
The occurrence-rate for each of the counter-sets and
for such other specimens as may be introduced will
never reach that level. In practice, an occurrence-
rate between 750 and 850 per 1,000 is usual.
Consider the present case, beginning with
Overview A. Among the eight specimen-texts, the
two by Waller show higher occurrence-rates than
the four associated with Marvell. But the ‘Fourth
Advice’ breaks the pattern, with an occurrence-rate
higher than that for Waller’s ‘Of the Danger’. In
Overview B, Marvell’s ‘First Anniversary’ shows
the highest score of the eight but the pattern of the
other seven scores is not authorial. These overviews,
then, do not support the idea that a given writer’s
overall word-list might serve as it stands as an
accurate authorial discriminator.
The main difficulty here is that any truly idio-
syncratic features of the two authorial frequency-
lists are buried among the high frequencies of words

that everybody uses. As the little array of raw
data in Table 2 reveals, the twenty most common
word-types of Waller’s set amount to about a
quarter of all the word-tokens in each of the
specimens. The steepness and the uniformity of the
descending hierarchy were observed by George K.
Zipf (1949) and enshrined in ‘Zipf ’s Law’. But as a
recent article (Hoover, 2004) has shown, the Delta
procedure continues to be effective for at least the
top 600 word-types of a well-founded word-list.
A merely additive procedure, however, like that
used for Overviews A and B, is too crude for the task
in hand.
A second difficulty, I believe, affects the use of
any measure of divergence for the analysis of
complete frequency hierarchies. It stems not from
the tyranny of the large numbers at the head of the
list but from subtler arithmetical differences among
the data at different levels of a given frequency-table.
In the topmost stratum, robust statistical compar-
isons can be derived from differently sized diver-
gences from a mean or median score. For each
common word-type in a range of specimens, a bell-
shaped curve provides a sound footing for a range of
useful operations. These curves are always skewed to
the right or positive side because such data yield
zeroes and very low scores for particular word-types
more often than very high scores. Sentences of some
length where ‘the’ does not occur are more common
than those where it occurs in abundance. But the
upward range is the more extensive. It is not hard,
for instance, to devise meaningful sentences where
‘the’ makes up a quarter or more of all the word
tokens: ‘The bald Anglo the blonde had eyed the
night before lay on the dirty mat. The haft of the
Greek’s dagger stood in the hairy chest. The blind
flapped and the scattered papers stirred in the breeze
from the broken pane. The blonde officer sighed at
the enormity of the task ahead. The upside? Yeah,
right—the Anglo sure was off the hot-list.’ Although
such levels cannot sensibly be sustained, many a
dreary, over-circumstantial novel suffers in the
attempt.
In the next stratum from the top, zeroes and
singletons are common but are not infrequently
matched against scores that run up from a handful
into double figures. In the lowest and most
extensive stratum, zeroes by far predominate but
are usually matched against scattered singletons
in simple binary contrasts. Means and standard
deviations can certainly be extracted from the
frequency-patterns of these lower strata. To put
them to the same uses as those of the top stratum
seems inappropriate in principle and can yield
disconcerting results. Let us return to Table 3 and
consider some examples of tests where the two
lower strata are separated from the top one and also
from each other. I have been labelling them as ‘Zeta’
and ‘Iota’ tests as a matter of convenience and as a
way of emphasizing that Omega, the last word on
these matters, is not yet within reach.
In the Zeta tests 2A and 2B (‘Delta’ being Test 1),
two stipulations are imposed. After breaking each
base-set, in turn, into five equal segments, we retain
only those word-types that occur in at least three of
the five. Of these, we discard those that occur fewer
than three times in the counter-set. In Test 2A,
Waller’s list of word-types is reduced from 2,876 to
185. In Test 2B, Marvell’s list of 4,323 is reduced
to 354. As stipulated, the contrast between each
base-set and the corresponding counter-set is very
marked. The real point of interest, however, lies in
the behaviour of the eight independent specimens.
In Test 2A, the occurrence-rates for the two Waller
entries, at 46.90 and 46.83 per 1,000, comfortably
exceed all their rivals. In Test 2B, the occurrence-
rates for the four poems associated with Marvell
exceed the other four.
The Iota tests 3A and 3B focus on the lowest
stratum of the word-lists. The first stipulation is that
a word-type should not appear in more than two
of the five segments of the appropriate base-set.
The second is that it should not occur at all in
the corresponding counter-set. The Waller-list is
thus reduced to 1,169 uncommon word-types, the
Marvell to 2,521. In Test 3A, the scores for the two
Waller entries far exceed their rivals. In Test 3B,
three of the texts associated with Marvell exceed
the rest. But the authorial pattern is broken by the
‘Fifth Advice’, which scores a trifle higher than the
‘Second Advice’. The range of the eight scores
indicates that this breach is due to a higher than
expected score for the ‘Fifth Advice’. The ‘Second
Advice’ does not fall far short of its true partners.
36 Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2007
J. Burrows
The score for the ‘Fifth Advice’ makes a useful
point. It reflects the fact that the tests in Table 3
are specifically designed to distinguish Waller and
Marvell from each other and not from anybody else.
A text by any other poet is not governed by such
differentiae and remains a wild-card, free to include
words from the base-set and not necessarily much
affected by the exclusion of words from the counter-
set. The stipulated contrasts may operate success-
fully on such texts but cannot be expected to do so.
It is as if, after establishing a set of differentiae to
distinguish chalk from cheese, one tried them on a
specimen of bone. The likeness to chalk in hardness,
density, and colour is adventitious. This is not chalk
at all. A more broadly based set of differentiae is
required for the more general task.
4.2 One against many: Waller and
twenty-four others
Simplicity of exposition has its place in a
demonstration-piece. In practice, however, head to
head contests between two putative authors are best
reserved for situations where no other candidates
need be considered. That situation can arise from
outside knowledge, as when only John Dryden and
the Earl of Mulgrave need be considered as possible
authors of the celebrated ‘Essay on Satire’. It can
arise, by experiment, from the use of exploratory
tests like principal component analysis and the
Delta procedure. But, as we have just seen, a
premature head to head contest can easily go awry.
Once a putative author has been identified,
by whatever means, it is possible to verify his or
her claim by using variant forms of the Zeta and
Iota tests. This can be done by matching a chosen
authorial base-set, as before, against a multi-author
counter-set. A table corresponding to Table 2 is
established. Columns A to I are retained unaltered.
But Column K is now occupied by the sum of all the
scores, for each successive word-type, of as many
other authorial sets as may be desired. Each of those
sets occupies its own column and contributes to the
sum. And Column J is now occupied by counts of
the number of those authors who use each of the
word-types. Any stipulated contrast between base-
set and counter-set can now be applied to whatever
specimens may seem appropriate.
In the present case, Waller supplies the initial
base-set. The counter-set is composed of the twenty-
four other authorial sets, Marvell among them, that
make up our main database. The specimens for
examination are the same eight poems as before.
They are tested against the twenty-four separate
authorial sets; twenty-one independent texts by
those same poets; and twenty texts by other
Restoration poets.
In Table 4, the Zeta test is based, as before, on
two stipulations. The first excludes all those word-
types that occur in fewer than three of Waller’s five
segments. The second excludes those word-types
that occur in more than twenty-two of the twenty-
four other authorial sets. The second stipulation
serves not only to help establish a firm contrast
between Waller and the rest but also to exclude
those very common words that are used in other
statistical procedures. The effect of the two stipula-
tions is to reduce Waller’s 2,876 word-types to 259.
These yield him 1,319 word-tokens at a rate of 95.32
per 1,000. The half-million words of the counter-set
yield 16,517 word-tokens at a rate of only 31.72
per 1,000.
In the top central panel of Table 4, it can be seen
that, at 72.94 and 59.00, the scores for the two
Waller poems easily exceed those for the other six.
The scores for Group A, in the panel below it, show
that the twenty-four authorial components of the
counter-set all fall well short of the two Waller
poems but that some of them exceed the least
Waller-like of the other six specimens. The mean of
these twenty-four sets is 31.24 per 1,000 and the
highest of them is only 41.84. The low standard
deviation of 6.06 suggests that the stipulations
employed have fallen with rather an even hand
across this group and also helps to emphasize the
sharp divergence of the Waller pieces from the rest.
But the true force of the test is felt in Groups B
and C, where the scores for the independent
specimens are arrayed. These two lowest sections
of the central panel show that the scores for the two
Waller poems are still not matched by any of these
forty-one texts. Neither those by members of the set
nor those by outsiders produce a serious rival. Two
of the pieces by outsiders score over 50 per 1,000.

Authorship in Different Frequency Strata
pindaric ode ‘On the Death of the Illustrious Prince
Rupert’.
Both poems share in the nationalistic rodomon-
tade in which Waller is among the more extravagant
of his generation. He is a strong exponent of
attitudes that (springing from a narrower tribalism)
were gaining ground in Europe, were later to cross
the Atlantic, and (chiefly to the detriment of
humanity at large) were to influence European
and world history in the ensuing 300 years.
Sing we the Glory of triumphant Arms.
So shall all Tyrants yield.
May the like Fortune meet all those
Who vainly dare oppose
Our Monarch’s sacred Law,
Our Nation’s noble Rage.
This fragment is from a pindaric ode ‘On our late
Victories by Land and Sea’. In admitting authorship
(while disavowing the bombastic sentiments), I note
that it is studded with words which Waller uses to
like purposes and which help to distinguish him
from most others. Of Waller’s 2,876 word-types,
259 meet the stipulations stated above. The ten most
common of them are: sacred, rage, glory, sing,
law, fortune, equal, reign, yield, triumph. The most
common such function-word is ‘like’, used as an
adjective.
The effectiveness of the Zeta test on this
occasion is undeniable. Its more general reliability
remains in doubt. A set of stipulations that identifies
texts characteristic of Waller’s maturity yields a
word-list that might well be less accurate in
identifying the love-songs of his youth or the
immense religious poems of his dotage. But such
words as the adjective ‘like’ might persist through-
out his long career.
The right-hand panels of Table 4 show corre-
sponding results for the Iota test. The stipulations
employed on this occasion exclude all those
words that occur in more than two of Waller’s
five segments and all those that occur in more
than ten of the twenty-four authorial components
of the counter-set. Waller’s 2,876 word-types
are reduced to 1,127. The 1,380 word-tokens
occur at a rate of 99.73 per 1,000 in the base-set.
They are matched by 8,406 at a rate of 16.14 in the
counter-set.
At 34.80 and 39.54 per 1,000, the two Waller
poems easily outscore the other six. They leave the
members of Group A far behind though the highest
of these lie above some of the six non-Waller pieces.
Some of the independent texts in Groups B and C
score higher than any in Group A. But none of them
approach Waller’s pair. The standard deviations for
all three groups are low.
Of the individual texts, the least remote are
Absalom and Achitophel and Christopher Wase’s
Divination. The former is a celebrated political
satire, the latter a pro-Wallerian contribution to the
debate focussed on his ‘Instructions to a Painter’. In
this less common range of words, we are obviously
tapping a different vein from that of Waller’s
patriotic effusions. The word-list now opens with
the following ten word-types: portion, armies,
exceed, fishes, indite, maker, Christians, tragedy,
Chloris, Turks. These and their successors have little
in common save for the salient point: they are words
used by Waller but not by most of his contempo-
raries. It is worth noticing, moreover, that they are
not truly rare words. There are few rarities even
among the 127 word-types used by Waller alone.
None of them occur more than twice in Waller but
the first six appear in two of his segments. The list
begins: repressed, Isaiah, Pandora, daw, piracy,
displaying, vizier, enlargement, Antarctic, forebodes.
4.3 One against many: Marvell and
twenty-four others
The two tests whose results are set out in Table 5
have Marvell as base-set and the other twenty-four
poets as counter-set. The size of the counter-set is
altered by the replacement of Marvell by Waller
among the twenty-four. The stipulations are exact
Marvellian equivalents of those used for Table 4.
As the right-hand panel of Table 5 makes clear,
Marvell responds almost as well as Waller to the Iota
test. Yet the 2,344 word-types that satisfy our
stipulations are miscellaneous indeed. As with the
corresponding set in Waller, few of them are rare.
The upper range of the list, the words that Marvell
shares with ten of the other poets, is marked by the
language of pastoral. But, as it must, the list grows
more idiosyncratic as more of the other poets are
excluded. The set of words used by Marvell alone

1,000 and so outscore the other four. They also
outscore the twenty-four authorial sets of Group A.
Of the twenty-one specimens in Group B,
Congreve’s comic tale, ‘An Impossible Thing’, at
40.70 per 1,000, outscores the ‘Third Advice’. Of
the twenty poems in Group C, John Tutchin’s
satire ‘A Search after Honesty’, at 44.60 per 1,000,
also outscores the ‘Third Advice’. The other three
Marvell texts outscore all others.
Tutchin’s brand of rough satire often yields
unexpected resemblances to satirical poems by other
authors. Congreve, like Milton, has a richer
vocabulary than most even when his large authorial
set is cut down. One effect is that he often uses more
of the uncommon words than most and, accord-
ingly, tends to encroach on the word-lists of his
fellows. Since Tutchin was a child of about six and
Congreve was yet unborn when the ‘Third Advice’
was first published, neither is a candidate for its
authorship.
To resolve the question without benefit of such
external evidence, the current set of stipulations
can be modified. In the present instance, perfect
accuracy is obtainable by discarding all the words
that are used by more than four of the other twenty-
four poets. The other obvious course is to set up
one-on-one contests (as illustrated earlier) between
the claimants. When the words they share are
excluded by the usual sort of stipulations, the
remainder afford a basis for weighing up their
respective claims. I have yet to encounter a case
where the Zeta and Iota tests fail when they are used
in a genuine one-on-one end game.
The central panel of Table 5 shows the results of
a Zeta test in which Marvell’s base-set is matched
against the counter-set of twenty-four authors. As
with Waller, the exclusion of words that occur in
fewer than three segments of the base-set and in
more than twenty-two members of the counter-set
yields a solid foundation. The rates per thousand
are 100.89 and 47.08 for base-set and counter-set
respectively.
The power of the Zeta test is seen once more in
the fact that, at 66.43 per 1,000, the rate for
Marvell’s ‘First Anniversary’ surpasses that of every
other specimen examined. Here, as with the Waller
poems in Table 4, the test ranks the authentic text
ahead of more than forty rivals. Of the main eight
poems, moreover, the ‘Fourth’ and ‘Fifth Advice’,
the two not considered to be Marvell’s, rank below
all of his. These are all much stronger results than
might reasonably have been expected of a test
treating of the middle frequency stratum. In that
hitherto neglected stratum, as I remarked at the
beginning of this article, the demands of subject and
occasion might be expected to prevail over the
effects of authorial habit.
For the Marvell satires, however, the central
panel of Table 5 shows the effect of those very
demands and is a stern reminder that the orienta-
tion of the Zeta test is not necessarily—and
therefore not always—authorial. Apart from ‘The
First Anniversary’, the poems associated with
Marvell are all outscored by many texts by various
other authors.
This sudden outcrop of failures needs to be
understood.8 Although Marvell’s corpus is diverse
in literary form, little of the unquestioned work that
comprises his base-set is satirical. Several of his
longer poems bear on affairs of state but his most
persistent note is pastoral. Given the stipulation of
consistent recurrence employed here, his word-list
for the Zeta test includes many words that occur
more often in pastoral than in other literary forms.
Poems of that cast are marked not only by some
loosely related lexical words but also by a tendency
to use function words that were already becoming
archaic. The twenty most common words of
Marvell’s Zeta-list are: flowers, doth, green, grass,
lest, unto, who (interrogative), straight, O,
Heaven’s, pure, grief, Oh, thine, hence, roses,
equal, stay, under, trees. Many of these twenty
word-types (like others from further down the list)
are more at home in Marvell’s pastoral lyrics than in
his satires where they occur, as a group, at less than
half the rate they attain in his main set. Taken
individually, several of them do show frequencies
normal for Marvell while others do not occur in any
of the political satires associated with him. The
leading examples of the first sort are ‘lest’, ‘straight’,
‘who’, and ‘under’. These can be taken as represent-
ing many other words, from further down the list,
words that Marvell is always inclined to use. The
leading examples of the second sort, which do not

Authorship in Different Frequency Strata
occur in any of these satires, are ‘grass’, ‘pure’, and
‘roses’. Other members of my little set of twenty,
like ‘green’ and ‘trees’, put in an appearance or two.
These, too, can be taken as representing a large
number of non-political words from further down
the list.
It must be emphasized that we are dealing not in
absolutes but in lexical probabilities. Most English
words can put in an appearance in quite unexpected
contexts. But such instances are heavily outnum-
bered, in any given context, by words more usual
there. Our language is so often metaphorical in cast
that even a satire on naval affairs is not proof against
the language of pastoral. Here is a fragment from
my ‘Dutch Comfort, or Our late Reverses at Sea’.
Even here, the unexpected words soon begin to be
outnumbered by those that might be expected. And,
thinking of what is likely rather than what is
conceivable—thinking, that is, statistically—one
would expect more sails than trees, more guns
than meadows in any long poem of this kind:
Far o’er the Atlantick Meadows, pure and green,
A threat’ning Clowd of Trees was to be seen.
Close-haul’d, but favour’d by the mounting Gale,
Van Tromp’s main Squadron of some forty Sail!
Our Duke, who strode the Poop with haughty
Mien
Had been outwitted by a Foeman keen.
Proud Phoebus but a Phae¨thon, we found,
Our Fates with his inextricably bound.
Consider the four word-types that I purposely
implanted here: pure, green, trees, and meadows,
together with the singular forms of the two nouns.
All told, they occur six times in the 14,198 words of
the three ‘Advice’ poems associated with Marvell.
In the other ‘Advices’, which comprise 2,312 words,
they do not occur at all. They occur only sparsely in
three of Marvell’s long poems, ‘A Poem upon the
Death of O. C.’, ‘An Horatian Ode’, and ‘Fleckno,
an English Priest at Rome’. Of their 4,503 words,
these word-types make up only six. Three of them,
all from ‘On the Death of O. C.’, are instances
of ‘tree(s)’. The rest are scattered single instances.
But Marvell’s ‘Upon Appleton House’ sets all
these figures in high relief. In that poem, they
occur twenty-seven times in 4,845 words.
In situations of this kind, little is gained by
altering the stipulations so as to modify the word-
list. To relax them is to weaken their power to
differentiate. To tighten them is likely to intensify a
given effect. Of the forty or so word-types that occur
in all five segments of Marvell’s main set, many are
redolent of pastoral. It is fair to suppose that any
pastoral poem, from Lycidas to Pope, would be
likely to achieve a high score in this particular
exercise and that no satire, from Dryden to Pope,
would be likely to match it.
Ultimately, of course, the question is not whether
I am justified in supposing that the dearth of
‘pastoral’ words in the ‘Advices’ is the main reason
why the Zeta test fails to identify three of those
poems as Marvell’s. The question is what to make of
a test where perfect accuracy is suddenly offset by
utter failure. Our three failures make it clear that
Zeta scores are not always reliable authorial
markers. Our three successes, in each of which the
scores for a specified poem surpass the scores for
more than forty others, suggest that the Zeta test
should not be discarded. That position is supported
by the fact that other trials I have made have shown
a high level of accuracy.
The difficulty, it seems, is that there is an
intractable weakness in our ‘model’, a select word-
list that does not reflect the full range of Marvell’s
repertoire. In such cases, a particular test may need
to be set aside. It is as if a doctor were to say, ‘I’m
pretty sure this is a new mutation. If I’m right, there
is no point in using our standard test this time.
We’ll just have to try another approach’. Far better
for him to do so than to go on against the grain
and discover the truth in an autopsy. Most poets
usually write within their customary repertoires.
Whenever they do so, the Zeta test shows high levels
of accuracy. When they do not, a reader should
know it. The language of the three main ‘Advices’
is Marvellian enough to enable the Delta and
Iota tests to operate successfully. The content-
words of the middle frequency stratum set these
poems apart from the main body of his work.
Now whereas even a good reader cannot easily see
trends in the frequency of very common words, any
reader of Marvell will recognize this large shift of
subject.

But is it appropriate to appeal to the reader’s
judgment in this way? What of the argument that
computational methods are meant to settle ques-
tions on which informed readers disagree? To make
that a sine qua non is an unreasonable demand.
Computational methods can often shed new light
on vexed questions. But, like all other forms of
inductive reasoning, they yield inferences, and not
absolute proofs. The best inferences will be drawn
by the best students of the full range of evidence:
with new methods, as with old, we are always
obliged to read and think. When disagreement
persists, our best recourse is a return to the
beginning. (One of Wittgenstein’s dicta comes to
mind: ‘Back to the rough ground. Look and see.’) It
may be possible to find a weakness in reasoning, to
form better inferences, or to show that the burden
of proof is altered by the new evidence. It may be
necessary to frame the question better and test it
afresh. In twenty-five years, however, I have scarcely
seen a case where well-founded computational work
remained seriously at odds with the scholarly
consensus.
5 Conclusions and Suggestions
One way of measuring the accuracy of these tests is
to declare an error whenever the score for a text by
the target-author is surpassed by that of any
other test-piece. In Tables 4 and 5, the members
of Group A, being components of the counter-set,
should not be used for this purpose. Where they are
involved, an ‘error’ is certainly a danger-signal: but it
would be specious to register ‘successes’ of this kind.
For Waller, therefore, in the present case, we are
measuring two poems of his authorship against
forty-seven others. The results of the Zeta test yield
no errors out of ninety-four comparisons. So, too,
for the Iota test. At no point does either of these
rather characteristic pieces encounter a near-rival.
Matched against forty-five poems by other authors,
Marvell’s ‘First Anniversary’ also yields a perfect
record of success for both Zeta and Iota. Its margin
of advantage, however, is often much less than
Waller’s was. The Iota test registers forty-five
successes out of forty-five for the ‘Last
Instructions’ and the ‘Second Advice’, forty-three
out of forty-five for the ‘Third Advice’. (Even this
last score becomes forty-five out of forty-five when
the second stipulation is tightened.)
All told, the Iota test yields 272 successful
comparisons out of 274, a success-rate of over
99%. The Zeta test is 100% successful for the two
Waller poems and ‘The First Anniversary’. With the
political satires, however, the Zeta test is unable to
distinguish Marvell from many of his fellows. The
errors reach double figures for all three poems and
the test is clearly inappropriate in such cases.
The one-on-one trials illustrated in Table 3 have
yet to yield a genuine error. But, as the only aberrant
score in that set indicated, such trials are better not
undertaken until wider-ranging tests (or firm
external evidence) have identified the main claim-
ants. Stipulations designed to distinguish one
author from one other cannot be expected to
work properly on a third.
Further trials will show whether our only
cluster of errors can be set aside as the effect of a
predictable mismatch. If it can, we are looking
overall at very high success-rates. That offers good
reason for undertaking further work. And the Iota
results, in particular, add to previous evidence that
three, but only three, of the ‘painter satires’ are the
work of Andrew Marvell.
Whoever undertakes them (myself I hope
included), such further trials should obviously
incorporate a range of variations on the stipulations
employed here. Experience so far suggests some
limits. It is always desirable to frame the second
stipulation, which governs the counter-set, so as to
exclude all the words that are used in common-
words analyses. It is sometimes necessary to tighten
this stipulation further in order to differentiate
between authors. If the first stipulation, which
governs the base-set, imposes too strict a rule of
consistency few words will survive. When (as was
noted earlier) the field is impoverished, the test is
open to adventitious effects. Too strict a rule of
consistency can also yield errors with genuine but
uncharacteristic texts. Another worthwhile varia-
tion, for use with texts too short to allow the
effective use of both Zeta and Iota, is what one
might call ‘Iota plus’. In this situation, the select list
might exclude only those words that occur in, say,
four or more segments of the base-set and also
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 22, No. 1, 2007 45
Authorship in Different Frequency Strata
exceed a fairly strict quantum for the counter-set.
Like Iota itself, this approach yields a completely
accurate differentiation between our four Marvell
poems and all the rest. For short texts, then, it might
well offer a useful check on the common-words
procedures.
Apart from short texts and over-strict stipula-
tions, aberrant frequencies most often arise in words
that might reasonably be culled. Henry Fielding is
more given than his sister to the adjective ‘simple’.
But her novel, David Simple, has a spectacular effect
upon the word-count. The compelling objection to
ad hoc forms of culling is that they make it too easy
to tip the balance in one direction or another.
In recent articles (e.g. 2004), David Hoover
successfully culled those word-types that exceed a
given frequency in any of the specimens. That
approach seems an effective way of controlling
aberrant behaviour in any of the specimen-texts
without favouring a preferred outcome.
Further trials should also establish whether it is
necessary, for the best effects, to work with text-sets
of uniform length. The obvious advantage is offset
by a sort of extravagance. This is less damaging with
drama and prose fiction than with poetry and
personal letters. Poetic texts and poetic corpora
both vary too much in length to lie easily upon a
procrustean bed. To obtain sets of uniform size, we
must either reduce the larger to match the smaller
or turn away from the smaller. Too little Milton and
Congreve or no Rochester and Sedley? Put like that,
the choice is too invidious to contemplate. A better
way to put it is that we need to determine what is
most appropriate, accepting only such limitations as
we must, and resisting them when we can.
With so many variations still in play, it is too
soon to offer a binding definition of a Zeta or an
Iota score. It is better, at least for the present, to
think of Zeta and Iota as working-labels for two
little families of tests based upon select word-lists.
The lists are formed on the basis of stipulated
contrasts between a base-set and a counter-set.
In Zeta, the stipulations admit only those word-
types that attain a specified level of consistency
in the base-set while failing to reach a specified
level, whether of consistency or of frequency, in
the counter-set. Iota rests upon the residue,
embracing word-types that do not meet the first
stipulation while occurring even more rarely in the
counter-set.9
The results offered in this article, along with
those obtained in other trials, suggest that these tests
themselves may be of real use in cases of doubtful
authorship. Although no two word-frequency tests
can ever be entirely independent of each other, each
of these tests employs frequencies from a different
stratum and, again, from a stratum other than that
used in the more familiar common-words proce-
dures. For good and ill, however, they are very
simple additive measures. Their ultimate value may
be less direct, lying rather in demonstrating that
evidence of authorship is indeed present in every
frequency stratum. Our task now is to find the best
ways of deploying it.

Notes
1 The provenance of the main ‘Advice’ poems is set out
in Margoliouth (3rd ed., 1971), where only the ‘Last
Instructions’ is accepted as Marvell’s. The most
accessible set of texts is in Lord (1963).
2 The corpus of about 540,000 words has been reduced
by some six thousand by setting aside three poems by
Waller and Marvell for use as independent specimens.
The corpus ranges widely across the work of the
following twenty-five poets: Aphra Behn (1640–89)
21,705 words; Alexander Brome (1620–66) 29,539;
Samuel Butler (1612–80) 30,932; William Congreve
(1670–1729) 30,917; Charles Cotton (1630–87) 12,625;
Abraham Cowley (1618–67) 19,272; Sir John Denham
(1615–69) 30,092; Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset
(1638–1706) 9,586; John Dryden (1631–1700) 18,238;
Thomas D’Urfey (1653–1723), 18,757; Robert Gould
(1660?–1709?) 29,110; Andrew Marvell (1621–78)
23,282; John Milton (1608–74) 18,924; John Oldham
(1653–83) 32,462; Katherine Phillips (1631–64) 29,004;
Matthew Prior (1664–1721) 32,000; Alexander Radcliffe
(floruit 1669–96) 11,889; John Wilmot, Earl of
Rochester (1648–80) 12,725; Sir Charles Sedley (1639?–
1701) 10,304; Elkanah Settle (1648–1724) 24,080;
Thomas Shadwell (1642?–92) 14,540; Jonathan Swift
(1667–1745) 30,974; Nahum Tate (1652–1715) 20,333;
Edmund Waller (1606–87) 16,443; Anne Wharton
(1659–85) 12,511. Most of the corpus was prepared
by John Burrows and Harold Love, assisted by Alexis
Antonia and Meredith Sherlock. The Marvell subset
was added by Christopher Wortham assisted by
Joanna Thompson.
3 Like the greater part of the main database, some of
the independent texts were entered, by keyboard, from
standard texts. The rest were downloaded from the
Chadwyck-Healey archive, to which my university
subscribes. I am much in debt to all those whose work
has made mine possible.
4 It is often useful to distinguish between word-types
and word-tokens. The many occurrences of ‘the’ in any
given text are called word-tokens, instances of the
word-type ‘the’.
5 See Burrows (2002, 2003) and Hoover (2004). A 1999
article (first shown to me in 1998) has a brief passage
in which absolute z-scores are used as a measure of
distance. Although I do not remember noticing it (in an
article whose weight lies elsewhere), it may have given
me a clue that came to mind when it was needed. I am
content, in any case, to yield precedence on this point.
See Forsyth, Holmes, and Tse (1999, 393).
6 An outline of the calculation and use of z-scores can be
found in introductory manuals of statistics. But readers
in need of such help may be best served by the lucid
plain-language account in Kenny (1982, 57–8).
7 My colleague, Hugh Craig, has been experimenting
successfully on these lines.
8 Willard McCarty has been a persistent and eloquent
advocate of the idea that we learn most from our
failures. One must hope that it applies to the following
remarks. See, for example, McCarty (2005), 286, s. v.
‘failure’.
9 The notion of constructing an authorial word-list and
then excluding those used by a stipulated number of
other writers has not, I think, been tried. But there is an
extensive literature on rare words, especially those that
occur only once or twice in a given text. David Holmes
(1994) offers a helpful summary of these procedures
(among others). More recently, access to electronic
archives has assisted in identifying words peculiar to a
given author. The work of Donald W. Foster offers
notable examples, embracing both success and failure.
The protracted controversy surrounding a failed
Shakespeare attribution (Foster, 1989) need not occupy
us here.
