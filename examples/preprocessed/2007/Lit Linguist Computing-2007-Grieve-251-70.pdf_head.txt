Abstract
The basic assumption of quantitative authorship attribution is that the author
of a text can be selected from a set of possible authors by comparing the values
of textual measurements in that text to their corresponding values in
each possible authorâ€™s writing sample. Over the past three centuries, many
types of textual measurements have been proposed, but never before have the
majority of these measurements been tested on the same dataset. A large-scale
comparison of textual measurements is crucial if current techniques are to be
used effectively and if new and more powerful techniques are to be developed.
This article presents the results of a comparison of thirty-nine different
types of textual measurements commonly used in attribution studies, in
order to determine which are the best indicators of authorship. Based on
the results of these tests, a more accurate approach to quantitative
authorship attribution is proposed, which involves the analysis of many different
textual measurements.
