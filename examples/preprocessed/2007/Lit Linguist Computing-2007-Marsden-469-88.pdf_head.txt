Abstract
This article examines the actual and potential use of software tools in research
in the arts and humanities focusing on audiovisual (AV) materials such
as recorded speech, music, video and film. The quantity of such materials
available to researchers is massive and rapidly expanding. Researchers need to
locate the material of interest in the vast quantity available, and to organize
and process the material once collected. Locating and organizing often depend
on metadata and tags to describe the actual content, but standards for metadata
for AV materials are not widely adopted. Content-based search is becoming
possible for speech, but is still beyond the horizon for music, and even more
distant for video. Copyright protection hampers research with AV materials,
and Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems threaten to prevent research
altogether. Once material has been located and accessed, much research proceeds
by annotation, for which many tools exist. Many researchers make some kind
of transcription of materials, and would value tools to automate this process.
Such tools exist for speech, though with important limits to their accuracy
and applicability. For music and video, researchers can make use of visualizations.
A better understanding (in general terms) by researchers of the processes carried
out by computer software and of the limitations of its results would lead to more
effective use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
