Abstract
This article reports on experiments performed with a large corpus, aiming at
separating texts according to the author style. The study initially focusses on
whether the classification accuracy regarding the author identity may be
improved, if the text topic is known in advance. The experimental results
indicate that this kind of information contributes to more accurate author
recognition. Furthermore, as the diversity of a topic set increases, the
classification accuracy is reduced. In general, the experimental results indicate
that taking into account knowledge regarding the text topic can lead to the
construction of specialized models for each author with higher classification
accuracy. For example, by focussing on a specific topic, the accuracy with which
the author identity is determined increases, the exact amount depending on the
specific topic. This also applies when the topic of the text is more broadly
determined, as a set of topic categories.
In an associated task, the most salient parameters within an 85-parameter vector
are studied, for a number of subsets of the corpus, where each subset contains
speeches from a single topic. These studies indicate that the salient parameters are
the same for the different subsets. Two fixed data vectors have been defined, using
16 and 25 parameters, respectively. The classification accuracy obtained, even with
the smallest data vector, is only 5% less than with the complete vector. This
indicates that the parameters retained in the reduced vectors bear a large amount of
discriminatory information and suffice for an accurate classification of the corpus.
