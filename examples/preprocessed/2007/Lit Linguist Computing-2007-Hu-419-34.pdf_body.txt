The Sheffield Corpus of Chinese (SCC),1 the
outcome of a pilot project funded by the British
Academy, was established in response to the lack of
a publicly available corpus of marked-up Chinese
texts for diachronic linguistic study. The first phase
of the expansion was completed thanks to a
Devolved Research Fund from the Arts and
Humanities Research Council of the University of
Sheffield. The objectives of this phase of the
expansion were simply to add samples of text
categories to each of seven time periods covered in
SCC, and to test and refine the initial mark up
system and the integrated search and analysis tool
developed in the context of XML (eXtensible

Markup Language). At this stage, SCC contains 40
marked-up Chinese text samples and over 430,000
characters2 with a mark up system and an integral
search and analysis tool that can locate and display
occurrences of any specified sequence of characters
and of word classes, and can also count and display
the frequencies by specified subcorpus, time period
and genre. Having completed this expansion phase,
we use SCC to examine Li and Thompson’s (1974,
1976) controversial post-verbal prominence
hypothesis of prepositional phrases (PPs) in
Archaic Chinese and their word order change
hypothesis of PPs in general in the history of the
Chinese language. In Section 2, we describe the
chronological framework and the progress in text
sampling. Section 3 outlines the mark up system
and the integral search and analysis tool. Section 4
tests and demonstrates SCC as a whole by examin-
ing the word order change hypothesis for PPs in
the history of Chinese. We show that Li and
Thomspon’s (1974, 1976) post-verbal prominence
hypothesis of PPs in AC and their word order
change hypothesis for PPs in general in the history
of Chinese are at best dubious. The syntactic
positions of PPs in all the time periods in SCC are
examined. In doing so, we show that even at this
early stage of expansion SCC enables insightful
investigation of linguistic development in Chinese.
2 Chronological Framework and
Text Sampling
As described in Hu et al. (2005), we have based the
major chronological framework of SCC [Archaic
Chinese (AC, tenth century BC-AD 220), Medieval
Chinese (MedC, 220–1368), and Modern Chinese
(ModC, 1368–1911)3] on Peyraube (1996), for two
reasons. One is that the division is based on
syntactic criteria and the other is that it has taken
into account the studies of many sinologists such
as Wang (1958), Chou (1962), and Dobson (1959,
1962). Within this basic framework of three
subcorpora Archaic, Medieval and Modern, SCC is
further divided into seven4 time periods based
largely on dynasties as illustrated in Table 1.
The texts selected for the first expansion stage of
SCC represent a wide range of kinds of writing
found in different time periods and are organized in
two major text types—literary and non-literary.
Both types contain texts of different genres.
The literary type contains works on poetry,
drama, folklore and fiction (general, historical,
romantic and mythological) and the non-literary
type on philosophy, sciences, history, warfare,
government, law, biographies and essays, religion
and travelogues. In the current SCC, the contents
distribution is: Archaic Chinese subcorpus 109,679
characters, Medieval Chinese subcorpus 147,492
characters and Modern Chinese subcorpus
175,522 characters. Sample text categories in SCC
at the end of the first expansion phase are given
in Table 2.
Table 2 shows the sixteen text categories
currently represented in the corpus. A brief
introduction to the content of text categories is
given below.
The category for biographies and essays includes
Dunhuang Bianwen Ji (A Collection of Dunhuang
Popular Narratives) which represents a popular
form of narrative literature flourishing in the Tang
Dynasty with alternate prose and rhymed parts for
recitation and singing, often on Buddhist themes
(Sun, 1996).
In the fiction category, sample texts were
selected from four subcategories: general, historical,
romantic and mythological. San Yan (Three Words)
by Feng Menglong (1574–1646), a compiler
of anthologies of popular literature in the Ming
Dynasty, contains collections of stories and is
sampled in the general category. One chapter
is selected from each of the three collections
in Three Words: Yu Shi Ming Yan (Words to
Instruct the World), Jing Shi Tong Yan (Words
to Warn the World) and Xing Shi Heng Yan
(Words to Awake the World). Historical fiction
includes texts from San Guo Yan Yi (Romance
of the Three Kingdoms) by Luo Guanzhong
(1330–1400) which is the first historical novel
written with chapters interwoven by the develop-
ment of plots. We also included a sample chapter
from Shui Hu Zhuan (Water Margin) by Shi Nai’an
(1574–1645), one of the four most famous novels of
X. Hu et al.

the Ming Dynasty. Water Margin is recorded in a
colloquial style compounded with oral conventions
and descriptive passages in prose narrative (Hanan,
1981). As such it is very useful for the historical
study of the vernacular language during that
time period. Romantic fiction includes sample
chapters from Hong Lou Meng (sometimes trans-
lated as Dream of the Red Chamber) by Cao
Xueqing (1715–63), one of the great masterpieces of
Chinese fiction. Mythological fiction includes
Xi You Ji (A Journey to the West) by Wu
Cheng’en (1500–82), a novel that is regarded as
representing the pinnacle of novels created in early
Modern Chinese. Supernatural fiction such as Liao
Zhao Zhi Yi (Strange Tales of Liao Zhai) by
Pu Songlin (1640–1715) is an intermediate category
and we decided to include it in the mythological
fiction category.
In the government category, we included sample
texts from Zhen Guan Zheng Yao (Administrative
Principles of Zhenguan Reign) by Wu Jing (670–
749). In the history category there are sample texts
from Shi Ji (Records of the Grand Historian) by
Sima Qian (about 145–90 BC), a Prefect of the
Grand Scribes of the Han Dynasty and also known
as the Father of Chinese history. This book not only
records basic annals of dynasties or rulers,
chronological tables and treatises among other
things but also serves as a model for subsequent
Chinese dynastic histories and is considered
a representative text of late Archaic Chinese.
San Guo Zhi (Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms)
by Chen Shou (233–279), the official and author-
itative historical text on the Three Kingdoms period
of China, is representative of early Medieval Chinese
texts. As Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms contains

three volumes giving smaller historical accounts of
three rival states Wei, Shu and Wu, we selected one
chapter from each of the three volumes.
In the category for legal works, the text sample is
from Shang Jun Shu (Book of Lord Shang) by Shang
Yang (390 to 338 BC). The Book of Lord Shang
consists of a collection of the works written in the
Legalist School represented by Shang Yang in the
Warring States period (475 to 221 BC) and records
the theory and the specific measures of the Shang
Yang Reform led by Shang Yang in 361 BC.
In the philosophy category, sample chapters were
selected from Dao De Jing (Classic of the Way and
Its Power) by Lao Zi (around the sixth century BC)
which is regarded as one of the core texts of the
Chinese way of thinking known as Daoism. Sample
texts were also taken from Lun Yu (The Analects) by
Kong Zi (551 to 479 BC) and from Meng Zi
(Mencius) by Meng Zi (372 to 289 BC). All
these provide rich sources of prose texts of early
Archaic Chinese.
The science and technology category includes
Meng Xi Bi Tan (Notes Written at Mengxi) by Shen
Kuo (1029–93) which is the first book written in
China about science and technology and records
scientific discoveries that the ancient Chinese had
made in almost all sciences. There is also Tian Gong
Kai Wu (Exploration of the Works of the Nature) by
Song Yingxing (1587–1666) which is known as the
first comprehensive book written in the world about
agricultural and handicraft productions.
The travelogue category includes Xu Xia Ke You
Ji (Travel Notes of Xu Xia Ke) by Xu Hongzu
(1613–32) in the Ming Dynasty. In the warfare
category there is Sun Zi Bing Fa (The Arts of War)
by Sun Wu around the sixth century BC, the first
book written in China about warfare.
As the summary above suggests, SCC mainly
contains written textual materials from all the time
periods in the history of the Chinese language.
However two types of spoken-like data are included.
One is a drama/play Dou’e Yuan (Dou’s Case of
Injustice) by Guan Hanqing (1271–1368), a famous
playwright in the Yuan Dynasty. The other is the
Medieval Chinese text Zhu Zi Yu Lei (Classified
Quotations of Zhu Zi) by Zhu Xi (1130–1200),
the most influential Chinese philosopher since the
time of Confucius and Mencius. The text is
characteristic of sermons and dialogues in the
vernacular and represents Zhu Xi’s actual speech
as recorded by his disciples. Texts like these are
generally regarded by scholars as a reflection of
planned monologue study that represents, if not
truly natural speech, some of the most ‘spoken-like’
registers (Halliday, 1991) available from earlier
historical periods (Biber et al., 1998). We believe
that it is important to include such texts in SCC
because they will provide researchers with useful
comparative data for the analysis of written registers.
There are also a small number of translation texts
in SCC such as the translation of a religious text Jin
Gang Jing (The Diamond Sutra), a Buddhist
scripture discovered in 1907 inside the Mogao
Caves, from the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During
the early Tang Dynasty the monk Xuan Zang went
to Nalanda and other important sites to bring back
scriptures. The Tang capital of Chang’an (today’s
Xi’an) became an important centre for Buddhist
ideology. From there Buddhism spread to Korea
and Japan. There is evidence in the text that
Buddhist thought began to merge with
Confucianism and Daoism, due in part to the use
of existing Chinese philosophical terms in the
translation of Buddhist scriptures. The Diamond
Sutra was the first dated example of printed
translation texts. Given that these translation texts
were written by highly educated people and
represented vernacular language used and spoken
at the time, we believe that the use of these
translations texts will not affect first language
quality and that their inclusion in SCC is justified.
As we use natural chapters to sample historical
texts (Hu et al., 2005), there are differences in the
lengths of text samples. For instance, a chapter from
a biographical essay Taiping Guang Ji (Extensive
Records of the Taiping Era) by Li Fang et al. from the
Five Dynasties (907–979) contains 3370 characters
whereas a chapter from a general fiction Yu Shi Ming
Yan (Words to Instruct the World) by Feng
Menglong contains 20,830 characters. SCC as estab-
lished at the end of this expansion phase contains
over 430,000 characters in forty text samples.
The texts for the first expansion stage of SCC
were selected to cover most of the genres and

time periods. For this stage, easy availability of
error-free texts in electronic form that are signifi-
cant in the Chinese language as a whole was an
important criterion. As the first-stage texts would be
used to develop the annotation system we concen-
trated on classic texts that were significant in
themselves in their time periods and had a lasting
effect on subsequent writings. One example, the Shu
Jing (Classic of History), a collection of documents
and speeches alleged to have been written by rulers
and officials of the early Zhou period and before,
contains the best examples of early Chinese prose.
The writings of Meng Zi (372 to 289 BC), along
with others, contain extensive use of comparisons,
anecdotes and allegories and developed a simpler
and more concise prose style noted for its economy
of words, which was effectively a template for
literary form for the following 2000 years. Similarly
the Shi Ji (Records of the Grand Historian) written
by Sima Qian (between 145 to 90 BC) served as
a model for historical texts for the following 2000
years. Another example, the Dunhuang Bianwen Ji
(A Collection of Dunhuang Popular Narratives)
represents a popular form of narrative literature
flourishing in the Tang Dynasty (618–907) with
alternate prose and rhymed parts for recitation and
singing, often on Buddhist themes (Sun, 1996), and
was crucially important for the development of
fiction in Chinese literature as ‘the predecessors of
the later popular short stories’ (Pru˚sˇek, 1970, p. 240;
also see Ma, 1976). The famous eighteenth-century
romantic fiction Hong Lou Meng (Dream of the Red
Chamber) established a lasting vernacular style and
is widely regarded as a master work in Chinese
literature. The crucial and complex question of
balancing text samples in different genres and time
periods will be a dominant aspect of the second
expansion stage.
3 The Mark up System and
the Integral Research and
Analysis Tool
From the onset of the project, we have been aware of
important issues associated with future interna-
tional data exchange, especially in the creation
of Asian language resources. We have therefore been
careful to comply with the standards and practice
set out in Xiao et al. (2004). As described in Hu
et al. (2005), the mark up system for SCC is
developed in the context of XML because XML is a
well-supported open standard, ensuring compat-
ibility and longevity for our data, and it also has an
excellent support for non-Latin characters. We
choose the UTF-8 character encoding standard for
SCC, which accommodates Chinese characters and
ensures compatibility between our corpus and all
standards compliant XML processing tools.
A small number of samples were downloaded
from the internet but most samples were collected
freely from the Yifan Library, Guo Xue and China
the Beautiful5 which are willing to provide free
access to their collections of texts written or dated
before the beginning of the twentieth century.
However, there were some problems that needed
to be resolved before the texts available could be
used. First, as nearly all the electronic texts we
collected came in simplified Chinese characters, they
were converted into traditional Chinese characters
in order to be faithful to the original texts. Second,
the texts contained errors in the first place and more
errors occurred in the converting process. Together
they gave rise to an error rate of about 2.5%. Most
errors were due to the automatic blind conversion.
Take the two characters 6 li and li as an
example. Although both characters were frequently
used in many historical Chinese texts, the conver-
sion tool available only accepts as part of its
traditional-form packaging. Every occurrence of
would be automatically converted into even when
what fitted the context was the distance measure
‘about half a kilometre’ rather than ‘inside’.
Errors like this were corrected manually. Each
electronic text file in SCC was proof-read and
corrected against the original texts (from various
sources) independently by two native speakers of
Chinese with a good knowledge of classical Chinese.
Another problem with historical texts is that
many of the texts in text categories such as
philosophy, government, history, religion and war-
fare have been published with notes and annotations
written by different scholars or historians in mostly
later time periods. For example, the text of the

Administrative Principles of Zhenguan Reign by
Wu Jing (670–749) contained annotations written
by Ge Zhi in the Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368). In
order to keep the prose qualities of original texts, all
the notes and annotations were removed from
the sample texts selected to be included in SCC. The
other problem we encountered in dealing with
ancient Chinese texts is that a very small number
of Chinese characters have become obsolete over
time. They are so rarely used nowadays that they
cannot be found in the CJK (Chinese/Japanese/
Korean) Unified Ideographs. At present, they are
represented as XML Internal Entities, which allows
us to replace them with an editorial note, or even an
image file we have created to depict the character.
The texts included in SCC range from tenth
century BC to early twentieth century. This has
made the tasks of word segmentation, part-of-
speech (POS) tagging and the following post-editing
of corpus text samples very difficult. McEnery et al.
(2003), for example, point out that the essential and
non-trivial process of word segmentation in Chinese
corpus linguistics is a problem even in their context
of homogenous contemporary Chinese texts. We are
aware of segmentation tools such as the Chinese
Lexical Analysis System (CLAS) developed at the
Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Zhang et al., 2002). That
system is based on a core lexicon which incorporates
a frequency dictionary of 80,000 words together
with POS information and modules for word
segmentation, POS tagging and unknown word
recognition. However this system was developed
using contemporary Chinese news texts and as
McEnery et al. (2003) point out, it performs poorly
on some genres, e.g. martial arts texts, and so even
for their synchronic corpus the annotation of texts
in all but few genres had to be manually corrected.
We decided that for the SCC diachronic corpus,
with its very wide range of genres and time periods,
the CLAS system was inappropriate.
For SCC we decided to build a lexicon and an
annotation system cumulatively from scratch using
experience gained from the successive texts pro-
cessed. The annotation process has an automatic
stage (based on the corpus lexicon and grammatical
rules) followed by manual editing. The automatic
process for each new text uses the current lexicon
containing all previously encountered lexical items
and the set of interacting grammatical rules and
specific examples. These elements are cumulatively
increased and refined as texts are added to the
corpus. Unresolved multiple tags and untagged new
lexical items at the end of the automatic stage are
resolved by manual post-editing. New lexical items
(tokens) encountered, as texts are POS tagged,
are added to the current lexicon. At the end of
the first expansion stage, the lexicon has over
35,000 entries. The annotation system has nineteen
basic word classes and 111 distinct tag labels
(Hu et al., 2005).
At this stage we have checked a few of the first
texts to be tagged with the current lexicon and did
not find inconsistencies in the tagging results.
However a part of the next expansion stage will be
systematic testing to ensure that the tagging system
is consistent and reliable.
At the end of the first expansion phase, the
integral search and analysis tool enables users to
retrieve all occurrences of any specified sequence of
characters or of any specified word classes or any
combination of the two. Searches can be further
restricted by subcorpus, time period and genre.
When a search is executed, the web interface returns
with a list of all occurrences within their immediate
textual context and frequency tables displaying the
proportions of occurrences in each subcorpus, time
period and genre.
This functionality is presently implemented via a
relational database which contains a record of every
character, its position in the texts and the word
classes to which it belongs. This database is
generated automatically from our XML files, using
SAXON.7 All searches available on the current site
are implemented via Standardised Query Language
(SQL) and Java Server Pages (JSP). We chose JSP
technology chiefly because of its entirely UTF-8
compliant architecture and ability to integrate with
the various Java tools used in the creation of the
corpus. Hence the aim is that researchers can use the
in-house search and analysis tool that is an integral
part of SCC. We believe that the improvement of
the integral search and analysis tool at this stage was
both important and necessary because it has made

it possible for researchers to carry out complex
searching and analysis of SCC remotely, via a simple
Web interface. We will of course consider the use of
different retrieval and analysis tools as our
project continues to expand, for instance, the
XML Aware Indexing and Retrieval Architecture
(XAIRA)8 concordancing engine employed by, for
example, LCMC (McEnery and Xiao, 2004;
Xiao et al., 2004).
4 Syntactic Positions of
Prepositional Phrases in the
History of the Chinese Language
In the early 1970s, Li and Thompson (1974, 1975)
claimed that the Chinese language was changing
from Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) to Subject-Object-
Verb (SOV). A major piece of evidence they cited to
support their claim was that PPs in AC were
predominantly post-verbal and that pre-verbal PPs
were a new development that emerged in MedC.
As the first expansion stage of SCC neared
completion we decided to use the developing
corpus to test this assertion.
Li and Thompson’s claim has met with adverse
criticism (see, for example, He, 1984, 1985; Sun,
1991) and while the position of PPs is a significant
factor in the study of language typology (Greenberg,
1963; Hawkins, 1983; Dryer, 1991; Liu, 2003) both
Li and Thompson and their critics alike based their
arguments on a very small number of texts. Their
rather few examples include (1) below.
(1) [VP V PP] (AC)! [VP PP V] (ModC)
a. chu yu you gu (AC)
emerge from dark valley
b. cong you gu chulai (ModC)
from dark valley emerge
Both sentences contain an adjunct PP of loca-
tion/source. It is post-verbal in AC but pre-verbal in
ModC. However, not all the post-verbal PPs in AC
can find pre-verbal counterparts in ModC. For
instance, in the AC example (2), the PP of goal
occurs in post-verbal position but its counterpart
in ModC cannot occur in pre-verbal position as the
ungrammaticality of (3b) shows.
(2) Li wang liu yu Zhi. (AC)
person-name emperor exile to place-name
‘Emperor Li was exiled to the state of Zhi.’
(3) a. Li wang bei-liufang dao Zhi. (ModC)
person-name emperor PASSIVE-exile to
place-name
‘Emperor Li was exiled to the state of Zhi.’
b. Li wang dao Zhi bei-liufang.
person-name emperor to place-name
PASSIVE-exile
(PASSIVE¼ passive marker)
Examples 2–3 also show that even if there are
some changes in syntactic positions of PPs from AC
to ModC as illustrated in (1), it does not follow that
all PPs in AC underwent similar changes in ModC.
In his study of the distribution of PPs in two only
(albeit large) texts from AC period, He (1984, 1985)
observes that the obligatory occurrence of pre-
verbal PPs amounts to 64% in one text and 80% in
the other. He argues that in the two texts he studied,
the Zuo Zhuan (Zuo’s Commentary, 500 BC) and
Shi Ji (Records of the Grand Historian, 100 BC),
pre-verbal position is the obligatory position for the
absolute majority of PPs in both texts. Sun (1991)
observed that pre-verbal and post-verbal PPs are
more or less equally distributed in AC period: 50%
in one chapter of a text and 45% in one chapter of
the other text and subsequently Sun (1996) noted
that while most PPs had at least one occurrence in
pre-verbal position, only half of them had occur-
rences in post-verbal position. Sun’s investigations,
like those of He and Li and Thompson, were
based on a very limited number of texts. Sun’s
counts of the distribution of PPs were in one

all these PPs and the distribution of post-verbal and
pre-verbal PPs in seven time periods in the three
subcorpora of SCC. The distribution of these PPs
(in the current SCC) broken down into post- and
pre-verbal positions is given in Table 3 as occur-
rences followed by frequencies per 10,000 words.
Log-likelihood (LL) tests on the occurrences of PPs
in the two positions show that the differences
between the distributions of PPs are statistically
significant in all the time period covered in the
current SCC (Table 4)10 and, for example, that the
changes in the proportions of post- and pre-verbal
PPs between the three subcorpora are statistically
significant (Table 5).
Fig. 1 and subsequent similar figures are pro-
duced using the data of Table 3 further broken
down into the seven component time periods of the
three subcorpora. Fig. 1 shows that post-verbal and
pre-verbal PPs have coexisted in all the time periods
and pre-verbal PPs have always been used more
frequently than post-verbal PPs. A 2 7 Chi-square
test on the post- and pre-verbal occurrences of PPs
in the seven time periods gave the calculated value
of 105.8 at the significance level of P < 0.001. Note
that although there are twice as many occurrences of
pre-verbal PPs as post-verbal PPs in ModC, it does
not follow that post-verbal PPs will be entirely
replaced by pre-verbal PPs because post-verbal PPs

and pre-verbal PPs have different syntactic
functions.
Table 3 and Fig. 1 show that PPs occur with
substantial frequencies in both post-verbal and pre-
verbal positions in all time periods. Post-verbal PPs
and pre-verbal PPs are almost evenly distributed in
AC: 42.8% versus 57.2% in early AC and 48.5%
versus 51.5% in late AC (also see Table 4). Our
findings strongly refute Li and Thompson’s post-
verbal predominance hypothesis for PPs in AC. We
can also see that while post-verbal and pre-verbal
PPs have been in coexistence in all time periods in
the history of Chinese, there have always been more
occurrences of pre-verbal PPs than post-verbal PPs.
Our investigation provides strong evidence against
Li and Thompson’s claim that pre-verbal PPs did
not become prevalent until the fifteenth or sixteenth
centuries, which renders untenable their claim that
the emergence of pre-verbal PPs was a new
development. Moreover, it can also be seen that
there has never been a historical time period in
which one of the positions was strongly
predominant as suggested by Sun (1991, 1996).
However, when individual prepositions are exam-
ined, we see that the overall trend indicated in Fig. 1
is made up of many disparate trends which we now
discuss in more detail.

preposition, and the other two commonly used
pre-verbal PPs: yu and wei (Table 3). Although
all these three prepositions occurred in both post-
verbal and pre-verbal positions in AC, a large
proportion of them are found in pre-verbal
position: 81.9% of yi, 91.2% of yu and 54.9% of
wei. Together they make up 83.9% of all the
occurrence of PPs in pre-verbal position in AC.
Yi is mainly used in marking direct object of a
double-object construction, the theme object of
a spatial expression, a nominal functioning as
an instrument and an attitudinal construction
in yi . . . wei form (Zhu, 1957; Bennett, 1981;
Peyraube, 1986; Sun, 1996). Yu is used to mark
comitative and wei to mark object and passive.
Distributions of pre-verbal yi, yu and wei are given
in Fig. 2.
Fig. 1 shows that pre-verbal PPs increased from
early AC to late AC (LL score 29.40, P < 0.001).
When we examined further the distribution of pre-
verbal PPs in these two periods in AC, we found
that the use of pre-verbal yi increased from 88.0
(frequency per 10,000 words) in early AC to 102.3 in
late AC, which is probably the main reason for the
increase of pre-verbal PPs in these two time periods
(Fig. 2).
The general occurrences of pre-verbal PPs
remained stable in MedC. Fig. 2 indicates that the
general decline of use of pre-verbal PPs was mostly
related to yi’s decline (LL score 5.31, P < 0.01).
Although the use of wei and yu remained fairly
stable throughout the AC and MedC, the use of wei
decreased slightly from the beginning of ModC
(1368–1644), which we will return to
shortly. Examination of the declining use of yi
reveals that two competing instrument and
object markers jiang and ba were emerging
in early MedC. The distributions of jiang and ba are
given in Fig. 3.
Fig. 3 shows that jiang started to emerge
from the beginning of MedC (220–581), earlier
than ba, which did not appear until middle MedC
(581–979). This refutes the general assumption
(Wang, 1958; Li and Thompson, 1974; Peyraube,
1989b, 1996; Sun, 1996) that jiang and ba began to
be used to mark objects between 700–1000. Analysis
of individual sentences marked by jiang at the
beginning of MedC shows that the preposition was
already associated with object marking. Of the
thirty-three occurrences of jiang used as a pre-verbal
preposition found in the period, twenty-eight (85%)
showed its use as an object marker and five (15%)
as an instrument marker. In late MedC (960–79),
jiang’s use as a pre-verbal preposition increased
slightly (LL score 2.12,11 P < 0.05). From the
sentences that we extracted that contained jiang in
this period, we found that its usage also involved
marking attitude and marking a theme in a spatial
expression (Sun, 1996). However there were still
many occurrences of pre-verbal yi near to the end of
MedC. Of the 801 pre-verbal PPs, 235 (29.3%) were
associated with yi.
Fig. 3 also shows that ba did not start to emerge
until middle MedC. From the sentences that
contained ba in middle MedC, we observed that
when ba first appeared, it was largely used as an
instrument marker. The use of ba as an object
marker was developed in late MedC (960–1368). Of
the thiry-two sentences that contained ba in this
period, twenty-seven (87.5%) showed ba as an

object marker. Following Zhu (1957), Sun (1996)
argues that in marking object, the ba-form is a
replacement of a similar construction marked by yi
in early AC (Ye, 1988; Mei, 1990). In other words,
ba is assumed to have come from yi by a simple
lexical replacement. This lexical replacement
hypothesis is not confirmed in our investigation.
It is clear from Figs 2 and 3 that yi started to decline
long before ba began to be used. By the time ba
emerged, some use of yi as an object and instrument
marker had already been shared by jiang. It is
therefore implausible for the yi-form to serve as an
analogical model for the ba-form as suggested by
Peyraube (1988).
By late MedC, jiang and ba appeared to have
replaced yi in marking object, instrument and
attitude though in the meantime their use in
marking instrument and attitude started to decline
as a result of emergence of other pre-verbal
prepositions such as gen from late MedC and
yong and na from early ModC. Gen, yong and na
are used to mark instrument and attitude in pre-
verbal position in present-day Chinese.
The decline of pre-verbal PPs in late MedC also
involves the use of wei as a pre-verbal preposition
marking passive. Wei marks passive construction in
two forms: -V wei-V and . . . 12 -V wei . . . suo-
V. The difference between wei-V and wei . . . suo-V is
that the former suppresses the agent whereas the
latter introduces the agent immediately after wei.
Fig. 2 shows that the use of wei started to decline
from late MedC (LL score 9.35, P < 0.01). In early
MedC, the proportion of wei’s use as a passive
marker was very high. Of a total of sixty-five
occurrences of pre-verbal wei found in early MedC,
forty-one (63.1%) were related to passive marking.
Among these forty-one passive constructions, eight
(19.5%) involved no agent. However, in late MedC
the use of wei as a passive marker decreased. This
seems to be related to the emergence of another
passive marker bei that emerged from early
MedC. Like wei, bei marks passive construction in
bei. . . (suo)V and bei-V forms in pre-verbal position
and can also be used to suppress the agent in a
passive construction. The distribution of bei and wei
is given in Fig. 4.
Analysis of occurrences of bei and wei shows that
although bei started to be used as a competing
passive marker in pre-verbal position from early
MedC, both wei and bei continued to be found in
marking passive construction for a long time during
MedC. It was not until early ModC that wei’s use
started to decrease again (LL score 1.49, P < 0.05),
coinciding with bei becoming dominant in passive
marking. It is natural to ask why the use of wei
declined when it was just as competitive and
flexible as bei. A plausible answer is that it was
due to the other pre-verbal usages of wei which
would likely cause ambiguity (Sun, 1996). For
instance, pre-verbal wei was also used to mark
benefactive or purpose. At the end of MedC, the
ratio of passive marking between wei and bei was
64% to 35.5%. In late ModC, wei was largely
replaced by bei as 86.7% of passive constructions
was marked by bei.
4.2 Post-verbal PPs
From Fig. 1 we can see that the use of post-verbal
PPs started to decline from the beginning of MedC
(LL score 26.32, P < 0.001). A closer examination
shows that most of the post-verbal PPs occurred
with three other most frequently used PPs in this
time period: yu1, yu2 and wei, which
together made up 45.3% of all the occurrence of PPs
in AC. Yu1 is generally regarded as an older form of
yu2 (Wang, 1958). All these three prepositions
occurred in pre-verbal and post-verbal positions but
79% of their occurrences are found in post-verbal
position. The distributions of these three post-
verbal PPs in AC are given in Fig. 5.

It is worth noting that these three prepositions all
have multiple usages. Both yu1 and yu2 could be
used in marking object, location, instrument,
benefactive and passive construction, except for
comparative construction where yu2 tended to be
used (Sun, 1996). Although both yu1 and yu2 have
survived into present-day Chinese, their current use
is limited to set phrases. Wei can be used in pre-
verbal position to mark benefactive, purpose and
passive construction. From Fig. 5, we can see that
the use of post-verbal wei has been quite stable in
most time periods except in early MedC where there
was a noticeable increase (LL score 5.30, P < 0.05).
Examination of sentences that contained post-verbal
wei in this period shows that wei seemed to be
involved in marking the second object of the main
verb in a double-object construction where the main
verb is subcategorised for two complements as
shown in (4).

Wu Zixu Bianwen)
sui li person-name wei guo daxiang
then establish person-name wei state prime-
minister
‘then made Zixu the prime minister of the
state’
We suspect this phenomenon is related to
the grammaticalization process of some transitive
verbs in the history of the language. However this
requires more detailed analysis which is inappropri-
ate here.
Like the pre-verbal PPs we examined earlier, the
occurrences of post-verbal PPs in AC also declined
over time (LL score 36.76, P < 0.001). As yu1, yu2
and wei are the most frequently used post-verbal
PPs in AC, the general decline in the use of
post-verbal PPs is inevitably related to their decline
(overall) in their use. Fig. 5 shows that although the
occurrences of both yu1 and yu2 started to decline
from the beginning of MedC, yu1 disappeared more
quickly than yu2 from middle MedC. As these two
prepositions are mostly interchangeable in their
uses except for comparative construction where yu2
was preferred (Sun, 1996) as mentioned earlier, we
refer to them as YU in the rest of our discussion.
One of the multiple uses of YU is to mark passive
construction in post-verbal position like ‘by’ in a
passive construction in English. The use of YU
marking the passive started to decline from the
beginning of MedC, which seems to coincide with
the growth of wei as a passive marker in pre-verbal
position during the same time period. Although YU
was a commonly used passive marker in post-verbal
position, it was unable to suppress an overt agent
because Chinese generally does not allow preposi-
tion stranding.13 On the other hand, wei marks
passive construction in two forms: wei-V and
wei . . . suo-V, which means that with pre-verbal
wei there is an option of suppressing the agent in a
passive construction. Of the thirty-six passive
constructions marked by wei in early MedC
(220-581), we found twenty-eight (77.8%) without
agent. This flexibility made wei a very competitive
passive marker for YU at the beginning of MedC. By
middle MedC the proportion of YU in marking
passive construction is reduced to only 0.7%. Our
findings are in line with Peyraube (1996) that the
lack of capability to suppress agent in a passive
construction marked by YU led to its decline in
marking passive construction.
However, passive PPs marked by YU are not the
first post-verbal PPs that disappeared as claimed in
Sun (1996) because other noticeable changes were
observed in the meantime. One noticeable change is
that YU ’s use as a post-verbal source/location
marker was gradually replaced by that of pre-
verbal zai14 ‘at’ from early MedC. The distribu-
tion of zai is given in Fig. 6.
Zai is a preposition that has been used in both
pre-verbal and post-verbal positions in all the time

However there is a difference in meaning depending
on the position zai occupies in a sentence. Post-
verbal zai marks direction whereas pre-verbal zai
marks location (Li, 1975; Li and Thompson, 1975;
Travis, 1984). Fig. 6 shows that the prepositional use
of zai started from very early on in AC, albeit rarely.
Fig. 6 also shows that the proportion of zai’s post-
verbal use increased noticeably from seven (fre-
quency value at per 10,000 words) in early
MedC (581–979) to 179 at the beginning of ModC
(1368–1644) (LL score 60.90, P < 0.001) and the
proportion of zai’s pre-verbal use increased very
quickly from twelve (frequency value per 10,000
words) in middle MedC to 235 at the beginning of
ModC (LL score 70.27, P < 0.001).
Zai is not the only preposition that was replacing
YU in marking locative constructions. There is also
dao ‘to’, which emerged in middle MedC to
denote goal in post-verbal position. From late
MedC dao was found to also mark location in
pre-verbal position as illustrated in (5).
(5)
(Dou’e Yuan)
ni yer liangge sui wo dao jia zhong qu lai
you sir two follow me to home inside go come
‘You two gentleman follow me and I’ll take
you to my home.’
By the end of ModC period, 74.6% of dao’s
occurrence is post-verbal, whereas 25.4% pre-verbal.
xiang1 ‘toward’ is another preposition that
emerged at the beginning of MedC. Together with
zi ‘since/from’ and cong ‘from’ that originated
in early AC but developed rapidly from the
beginning of MedC, xiang1 has since been used in
marking location/source in pre-verbal position as
shown in (6) apart from goal for which only post-
verbal xiang1 tends to be used.
(6) ,
(Dou’e Yuan)
zhede shi yamen cong gu xiang1 nan kai
this is government-office from ancient
towards south open
‘It is true that ever since the ancient time
yamen have been open to the south15.’
From middle MedC, a few more new preposi-
tions emerged in association with three of the many
uses of post-verbal YU: the marking of comitative,
dative/benefactive and instrument. There was dui
‘to’, that emerged in middle MedC, and tong
‘with’ and gen ‘with’ that appeared in late MedC.
They are used to mark comitative in pre-verbal
position. There was ti ‘for’, that emerged near the
end of MedC and gei ‘for’, that appeared in late
ModC. Both of them are used in marking dative/
benefactive in pre-verbal position though gei some-
times also occurs in post-verbal position. yong
‘with’ started to be used to mark instrument from
middle MedC whereas na ‘with’ was barely used
until early ModC.
The use of YU in marking comparative and simile
constructions was taken over by si ‘similar to’ and
ru ‘like’ that emerged and developed in middle
MedC and tong ‘with’ and bi ‘compared to’ that
started to emerge from late MedC. Ru and si were
found in marking similitude in both pre-verbal and
post-verbal positions and in marking comparative
construction in post-verbal construction. Tong and
bi were found in marking similitude construction
(Zheng, 1985) in pre-verbal position.
It seems that all these occurrences exerted
a specific effect on the decline in the use of post-
verbal YU and hence on the decline of general
use of post-verbal PPs from early MedC.
The evidence of our study supports Sun’s (1996)
suggestion that the decline in the use of post-
verbal YU can be attributed to its multiple func-
tions that are likely to cause ambiguity in
communication.

5 Conclusion
On the basis of the current SCC, Li and Thompson’s
(1974, 1976) post-verbal predominance hypothesis
for PPs in AC is refuted. Our study provides no
evidence for their word order change hypothesis for
PPs from post-verbal in AC to pre-verbal in ModC.
Contrary to Li and Thompson’s (1976) claim, there
is clear evidence that pre-verbal and post-verbal PPs
have coexisted in all the time periods in the history
of the Chinese language, and that pre-verbal PPs
have always been used more frequently than post-
verbal PPs. Our study also provides strong evidence
against Li and Thompson’s claim that pre-verbal
PPs did not become prevalent until the fifteenth to
sixteenth centuries, which renders untenable their
claim that the emergence of these pre-verbal PPs
was a new development. However, it is clear that the
proportions of individual PPs in the two positions
change over time: uses of some post-verbal PPs
disappear whereas uses of other pre-verbal PPs
emerge. Proportions of uses of both positions also
change over time: marking of location/source that
used to be denoted by post-verbal PPs is now taken
over by PPs in pre-verbal position though marking
of other uses such as goal has always been denoted
by PPs in post-verbal position. The decline in the
use of some of the most frequently used PPs in AC,
whether in post-verbal or pre-verbal position, is
consistent with the suggestion that the ambiguity
that is caused by the multiple functions that these
PPs had could be the main cause for their decline
because the emerging PPs that replace them have
more specific functions. Although there are over
twice as many occurrences of PPs in pre-verbal
position as in post-verbal position in ModC, it does
not necessarily follow that post-verbal PPs will
be replaced by pre-verbal PPs. Different syntactic
positions entail differences in meaning, which
determines that the different functionality of post-
verbal PPs cannot be replaced by PPs in pre-verbal
position and vice versa.
This article reports the completion of the first
expansion phase of the SCC. We described some
major developments of SCC in terms of text
sampling, the mark up system and the integral
search and analysis tool. A diachronic linguistic
study carried out on the word order change of PPs
in the history of the Chinese language using the
developing SCC shows the usefulness of the corpus
under construction.

2 In this article, we distinguish between ‘characters’
(individual Chinese characters) and ‘words’ (tokens,
or individually tagged text fragments) (also see Wu
and Tseng, 1993; McEnery et al., 2003; Hu et al.,
2005).
3 Peyraube’s Modern Chinese period has been expanded
to 1911 because it was the year when the last dynasty in
that period ended.
4 At the end of the pilot project there were eleven
projected subdivisions but for the first expansion phase
we decided to reduce them to seven to avoid extreme
differences in the size of their contents. Western-Han
and Eastern-Han were combined to form a subdivision
Han (206 BC to AD 220), Sui, Tang and Five Dynasties
to form Sui and Tang and Five Dynasties (581–979),
and Song and Yuan to form Song and Yuan
(960–1368).

9 Prepositions with a total occurrence  10 are excluded
in this investigation.
10 The critical LL score for P < 0.001 is 10.83.
11 For one degree of freedom, a calculated value of 3.84
or higher is significant at the level P < 0.05.
12 suo is regarded as a clitic prefixed to a transitive verb
followed by an overt object (Wang, 1958; Peyraube,
1989a; Sun, 1996).
13 Preposition stranding refers to the phenomenon in
which a preposition is not followed by an overt noun
phrase. Some languages such as English allow
preposition stranding. For example, in the sentence
‘This is the North Face I told you about’ the
preposition ‘about’ is not followed by a noun, but
the sentence is grammatical.
14 Apart from being a preposition, zai (and zheng
zai) can also be used as a progressive aspect marker
before action verbs to indicate an ongoing action as
shown in (1). This use of zai was excluded from the
frequency data in Fig. 6.

‘(He) just saw that all the royal members were

15 We should point out that the phrase ‘open to the
south’ does not mean simply that yamen entrances are
on the south side. In fact they are but this is an
idiomatic expression complaining that yamen or
government officials operate for themselves rather
than for the people as a whole.
