There are several alternative ways of saying the
same thing, arising from both register differences and
speaker variables, such as gender, age, socioeconomic
class, and regional background. This variationist or
sociolinguistic approach to language contests the
traditional view of language as tending towards a
balanced state where each function is realized by one
form only. The analysis of linguistic variation has
proved essential for our understanding of the
processes of language change. In studies of differ-
ences in linguistic usage between populations or
points in time, a crucial task is to quantify the
frequencies of linguistic features. In its simplest form,
the question can be posed as follows: suppose there
are two alternative forms A and B of a word,
grammatical construct, etc.; what is the frequency of
the use of each? Of course, several problems have to
be tackled even before this question can be asked. Are
the forms A and B really well-defined? What are the
populations we are comparing? Is the sample
representative? And so forth.
In this study, we consider the seemingly simple
task of estimating the frequency of alternative forms
on the basis of available data. In diachronic research

in particular, sample sizes tend to be small, and the
amount of linguistic data is beyond the control of
the researcher. It is, therefore, important to get
information about the uncertainty in the result: we
need methods that provide information about
how reliable the estimate of the frequency of the
linguistic variable is.
The simplest method to use is pooling, i.e.
combining all the observations, and computing the
frequency of each form over a given time period.
Almost as simple is computing the average of
individual averages. These methods provide a single
estimate, and give no direct indication of how
reliable or unreliable that estimate is. Bootstrapping
(Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) is a general technique
that can be applied in this type of situation. In
bootstrapping, one repeatedly creates new data sets
from the original data by sampling with replace-
ment. For each such data set one computes the
frequency by pooling or averages of averages, and
uses the distribution of the frequency in the sampled
data sets as a way of obtaining confidence intervals
for the frequency in the original data. Bootstrapping
is easy to implement, and has been used in a wide
variety of tasks. Linguistic applications are descri-
bed in, e.g. Ogura and Wang (1996), Collins et al.
(2004), and Spencer et al. (2003).
Pooling and averages of averages are maximum
likelihood methods, i.e. they try to obtain one
estimate for the value of the unknown frequency
u of the new form. Bootstrapping and other similar
methods provide ways of measuring the uncertainty
in this estimate. Bayesian methods, on the other
hand, consider the unknown parameter u as a
random variable, and estimate the probability dis-
tribution for u, not just a single (most likely) value
as in maximum likelihood methods. Bayesian statis-
tics is very well-developed (Bernardo and Smith,
1994), and it has been used in many domains. For
applications in linguistics, see for example, Eisner
(2002) and Clement and Sharp (2003).
In this article, we will consider the bootstrap
method and the Bayesian approach for analyzing the
frequency of use of an incoming form. Having des-
cribed both methods and discussed their properties,
we will demonstrate their application to the data
provided in Nevalainen and Raumolin-Brunberg
(2003), drawn from the 2.7-million-word Corpus of
Early English Correspondence (CEEC). The software
for the Bayesian method is available at http://
www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mannila/smallsamples/.
The rest of this article is organized as follows:
Section 2 describes the background for the study
and the material sampled from the CEEC; Section 3
considers the introduction of the subject you, a
linguistic phenomenon we use as our case study; in
Section 4, we present the basic principles of the
methods, describe their implementation, and study
some simple examples; Section 5 examines the
results for the data from the CEEC in more detail,
and Section 6 is a short conclusion.
2 Background
Sociolinguistics investigates the multitude of func-
tions that language performs in modern society.
At any given time, there are different ways of saying
the same thing, not only in terms of register but in
terms of speaker variables. This approach to language
variation calls into question the traditional view of
a one-to-one correspondence between meaning and
form. Correlations between linguistic and external
variables have also proved relevant to our under-
standing of the processes of language change.
Understanding language change is one of the
major goals of sociolinguistic inquiry. One of the
principal tenets of sociolinguistics has long been
that the present could be used to explain the past
(Labov, 1972, 1994). It is argued that, as living
languages continually vary and change in patterned
ways, the principles of language change could be
arrived at by studying the present. From a language
historian’s point of view, it is, however, equally
evident that present-day sociolinguistics cannot
replace the study of linguistic variation in the past
in its own right.
The key to understanding the social embedding
of language change, past as well as present, is to
examine texts that come as close as possible to day-
to-day interaction between people. The data used in
this study comes from the Corpus of Early English
Correspondence (CEEC)1, about 2.7 million running
words, consisting of 6,039 letters written by
778 people between the early fifteenth and late

seventeenth centuries (Table 1). The vast majority of
these writers represent the higher social ranks, the
gentry, and professionals, but the aim of the corpus
compilers has been to provide as balanced a social
coverage as possible with the resources available.
Besides chronological and regional variation, the
external variables studied using this material include
gender, domicile, social status, mobility (social and
geographic), level of education, and register varia-
tion defined in terms of the relations between
the writer and the addressee (Nevalainen and
Raumolin-Brunberg, 2003, 43–9, 190).
3 Test Case: The Introduction
of Subject you
As the linguistic example for this article we have
chosen the introduction of the traditional object
pronoun you in the subject function, which took
place during the period c. 1450–1600. It is one of the
fourteen changes discussed in detail in Nevalainen
and Raumolin-Brunberg (2003).
The whole second-person pronoun system under-
went two major changes in Late Middle and Early
Modern English (1350–1700). Firstly, the singular
pronoun thou/thee was replaced by the plural
pronoun ye/you. Secondly, the object form you
came to be used in the subject function, gradually
ousting the historical subject form ye from the
language. After a gradual start in the fifteenth cen-
tury, this change diffused rapidly and was completed
in the sixteenth century. Examples (1)–(4) illustrate
the use of these second-person pronouns. Example
(1) contains only ye in the subject position, while (2)
is one of the earliest occurrences of you in the CEEC.
Examples (3) and (4) illustrate variable use during
the rapid diffusion of you.
(1) Plese it you to vnderstond that Will Cely
told me that ye had no knowledge from
me fir payment of the xx li. ye of your
curtesy delyuerd vnto William Lemster
my seruaunte/to my gret marvel.
(William Dalton, 1487; CELY, 228)2
(2) I wnderstonde that yow haue ben sore
seke ande now well rewiwid, . . . (Thomas
Kesten, 1479; CELY, 67)
(3) I perceve by your seid lettre, for asmyche
as ye be ridyng forster in the New fforest
undyr the Duke of Suffolke, ye say
that you may lawfully take your eaise in
ony lodge within the seid forest.
(William Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel,
1530s; WILLOUGHBY, 24)
(4) you knowe for a certenty and a thinge
without doubt, that you be bownden to
obey your souerain lorde your Kyng. And
therfore are ye bounden to leaue of the
doute of your vnsure conscience in
refusinge the othe, . . . (Sir Thomas
More, 1534; MORE, 505)
The first occurrences of subject you were found in
ambiguous linguistic contexts, for example, after the
verb in questions and imperatives. As for what
caused the change, several suggestions have been
made. Phonological confusion is a likely cause, since
both pronouns apparently had a similar weak or
fast-speech form pronounced [j@] or [ju]. A further
factor increasing confusion may have been the
personalization of impersonal verbs, e.g. if you
please, if ye please (Lutz, 1998). After the early
period, the linguistic constraints seem to disappear,
and mixed cases such as Examples (3) and (4)
become frequent. The diffusion of the new use of
you was quite a rapid process, completed by the
second half of the sixteenth century.

text we know how many times form A (such as a
new form like you) and form B (a corresponding old
form like ye) occur. We assume that there is an
underlying frequency of form A in the population,
and we want to estimate this. Such estimates are
denoted by uˆ.
4.1 Simple methods
We next describe the principles of two simple
approaches. Suppose we have data from N individ-
uals. For each individual i¼ 1, . . . ,N, let ai be the
number of times form A occurs in the texts by i, and
let bi be the number of times form B occurs in the
texts by i.
4.1.1 Pooling
The simplest approach is to pool all counts from the
individuals in a given time period. That is,
u_ ¼
PN
i¼1 aiPN
i¼1 ðai þ biÞ
ð1Þ
Pooling suffers, of course, from the problem that if
one individual has used the form A or B or both
very often, i.e. if the value of ai or bi is large, then
that individual dominates the result.
4.1.2 Averaging the averages
Another simple method is to calculate the frequency
of use of form A for each individual, and average
those percentages over the given time interval:
u_ ¼ 1
N
XN
i¼1
ai
ai þ bi
 !
ð2Þ
Averaging suffers from the opposite problem from
pooling: as individuals have equal weight, a person
who has used form A once and form B also once has
the same impact on the frequency estimate as an
individual who has used form A 100 times and form
B once.
As an example, consider the data shown in
Table 2 on all the male informants in the period
1540–59. There are large differences in the number
of observations per individual, and since the change
from ye to you is just taking place, the individual
ratios of usage of the new form, ai/(aiþ bi),
vary considerably. Pooling gives us an estimate of
0.33, while averaging the averages gives 0.57.
4.1.3 Bounds on the occurrence frequencies
The problems with pooling and averaging can be
avoided to a certain extent by suitable selection of
data. For averaging one might require that in order
for the data for person i to be included in the
analysis, the number of occurrences of the linguistic
variable (i.e. aiþ bi) should be higher than a given
quantity. For pooling, one could do the opposite,
i.e. remove persons with very high counts of ai or bi
or both from the analysis. Individual quotas have
also been applied to limit the influence of people
with very high numbers of occurrences. Such
methods are slightly ad hoc, but they have never-
theless been used with good success. Nevalainen
and Raumolin-Brunberg (2003, 214–17) compare
averaging with pooling, with and without individual

quotas, and introduce three rather similar curves
for two Early Modern English changes. The major
differences detected occur when one informant
clearly dominates, like the merchant John Johnson
writing in 1540–59, who preferred the conservative
form ye. Johnson’s material accounts for about 20%
of all the occurrences of the variable, and it is clear
that in this case pooling gives a lower percentage for
the new form you than the other two methods.
4.2 Bootstrap methods
The idea in bootstrap methods (Efron and Gong,
1983; Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) is to resample the
data several times, i.e. select a number of random
sets of the observations, and then to compute the
frequency of occurrence of the new form in each
resample. This is done for, say 1,000 samples, and
the variation in the frequency in the resamples gives
us a confidence interval for the frequency in the
original data.
The resample is formed with replacement. In
other words, given the data (ai, bi) for i¼ 1, . . . ,N,
we generate N random integers i1, i2, . . . , iN, from
1, . . . ,N, and the resample D0 consists of the
observations ðai1 , bi1 Þ, ðai2 , bi2Þ, . . . , ðaiN , biN Þ. Note
that the resample can contain many copies of an
original observation, and that some of the original
observations are not included in the resample.
Given the resample D0, we compute the fre-
quency u of the new form by, e.g. pooling or
averaging the averages. This is repeated for many
resamples D0, which gives us an empirical distribu-
tion of u. An estimate for u is obtained from the
median of u in this distribution, and confidence
bounds for the frequency u can be found by taking
the (say) 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of this distribution.
As an example, using the data in Table 2 and
creating 1,000 samples, we obtain the empirical
distributions of the pooled frequencies and averages
of averages shown in Fig. 1. The median and con-
fidence interval for the pooled estimate are 0.34
(0.17–0.64) and those for the average of averages are
0.57 (0.46–0.68). We see that the pooled estimates
of the probability have a much larger variability
than those of the averages of averages. This is due to
the presence of individuals such as John Johnson
with a large number of observations: the presence or
absence of these persons in the bootstrap sample
has a strong effect on the pooled frequency of the
sample.
The bootstrap method has a wide range of
applications; see, e.g. Zoubir and Boashash (1998).
There is an elaborate theory of the use of the
bootstrap, and it can be shown that the estimates
and confidence intervals obtained by using it have
many desirable properties.
4.3 Bayesian approach
Maximum likelihood approaches aim at finding
the most likely value for a parameter. In many
situations it is not reasonable to assume that there
would be one true value of the parameters. Bayesian

statistics (Gelman et al., 2004; Bernardo and Smith,
1994; Gamerman, 1997; Gilks et al., 1996) is a widely
used method in which the basic idea is that the
parameters are also considered to be random
variables, i.e. quantities with variation. For our
example case of the frequency of usage of form
A for the individuals in question, in the Bayesian
approach we assume that this frequency is the
quantity u, and then we try to estimate the
distribution of the u, instead of a single estimate uˆ.
Let us assume that we have a prior probability
P(u) for each possible value of u. For example, we
can assume that each possible value of u between 0
and 1 is equally probable. Let us denote by ui the
probability that individual i will use the new form;
we assume that there is a probability P(ui | u) that ui
will have some value, given the value of u. Finally,
let P(ai,bi | ui) be the probability that individual i
uses the new form ai times and the old one bi times,
given the value of ui. This likelihood is the well-
known binomial probability:
Pðai, bijuiÞ¼
ai þ bi
ai
 
uaii ð1  uiÞ
bi : ð3Þ
Note that this probability does not depend on u, but
only on the individual probability ui.
Let us denote the data by D; thus D consists of
the values ai and bi for N individuals. Given the
values of the parameters u and ui for all i, the
likelihood of the data D is
PðDju, u1, . . . , unÞ ¼
YN
i¼1
Pðai, bijuiÞ ð4Þ
That is, given the parameters, the probability of
observing the data is the product of the probabilities
of the data from each individual.
Using Bayes’ rule, we can invert the probability
in Equation (4):
Pðu, u1, . . . , uN jDÞ

YN
i¼1
Pðai, bijuiÞ
¼ Z1PðuÞ

i¼1
PðuijuÞPðai, bijuiÞ ð5Þ
Here Z is a normalizing constant. That is, the
probability of having a certain combination of
values for the parameters u and ui for all i, given the
data D, is proportional to the prior probability of
the value of u [the term P(u)] times the probability
of the individual parameters having the values times
the probability of the data.
In general, we are not very interested in the
individual probabilities ui; rather, we want to find
the distribution of the general probability u. This
can be done by summing up all possible values of
the parameters ui, as follows:

a form that is much easier to compute. That is, the
posterior probability of a value of the general
probability u is proportional to the prior probability
P(u) of u times the product of the probabilities of
observing the data of the individuals for some values
of the individual probabilities ui.
The Bayesian estimate uˆ for u is obtained by
computing the expected value of u under this
distribution:

To complete the description of the model, we
need to specify the prior probability P(u) and the
probability P(ui | u) of an individual probability,
given the value of u. For the prior probability P(u)
we simply use the uniform distribution: every value
of u is equally probable. For the probability P(ui | u)
we use
PðuijuÞ/expðCðui  uÞ2Þ, ð9Þ
where C is a constant. The role of C is to determine
how strongly the individual parameters ui depend
on the general probability u. If C is large, then
deviations of the parameters ui from u is unlikely,
while for small values of C such deviations can

happen more easily. The choice of C does not effect
the results very strongly; we use C¼ 10.
The Bayesian model has a form that can be
implemented in a simple way. We precompute for
each data point (ai,bi) and possible value of the
parameter ui the probability P(ai,bi | ui). Similarly,
for each pair of possible values of u and ui we
compute P(ui | u). An accuracy of 0.01, for example,
yields 10,000 different pairs of u and ui, and
computing P(ui | u) for all the pairs is quite feasible.
The Equation (5) now makes it possible to compute
for each possible value of u an estimate of the
posterior probability P(u |D). More complex
Bayesian models can be handled by using MCMC
techniques (Gamerman, 1997; Gelman et al., 2004;
Gilks et al., 1996); sophisticated software exists for
estimating the posterior probability for many types
of models (Lunn et al., 2000).
From the posterior distribution P(u |D) we can
further compute the interval (r,s) of values such as
to give a probability of at least 95% that the value of
u is within that interval; such an interval is called a
95% posterior interval in Bayesian literature.
Next we give some comments on the different
approaches. Table 3 summarizes the results of the
different methods for the data in Table 2. The
pooling method estimates that the frequency of you
is about one-third. However, the presence of
persons like Anthony Cave and John Johnson has
a strong influence on this estimate, as the number of
cases for them is very high. The average of averages
gives a higher estimate, as the number of persons
preferring you is high, 57%. The Bayesian estimate
is in between these two estimates, as more weight
is given to individuals with larger numbers of
observations.
Some of the differences between the Bayesian
approach and the bootstrap method for ascertaining
confidence or posterior intervals are most clearly
observed by looking at artificial data. As an extreme
example, suppose we have one individual who used
the new form once and did not use the old form at
all, i.e. we have one observation of the form (1,0).
All the bootstrap resamples are identical, and the
pooled estimates and average of averages for each
resample will be exactly 1, implying that the
confidence interval is also (1,1). In general, for
any sample, no matter how small, in which the
one of the forms does not occur at all, yields in
the bootstrap approach a confidence interval of
width 0.
For this tiny data set with one observation (1,0),
the Bayesian approach uses the prior information
P(u) about the probability of different values of u,
and yields the estimate 0.66, with posterior interval
(0.06–0.98), showing the wide range of variability in
the estimate. Assume next that we have data from
five individuals, and that each of them has used the
new form five times and the old form zero times.
Then all the bootstrap resamples will have five
occurrences of the pair (5,0), and thus the bootstrap
method again indicates that the usage frequency of
the new form is equal to 1. On the other hand,
the Bayesian estimate is 0.93 (0.72–0.99) for the
parameter u. A sample of twenty observations (5,0)
gives an estimate of 0.97. Increased evidence for
the unequivocal use of the new form increases the
Bayesian estimate, as the weight of the data is
balanced against the uniform prior assumption of
all values of u being equally likely.
We also implemented another version of
the Bayesian approach for hierarchical binomial

this approach, the general probability u is parame-
trized by using a beta distribution with two
parameters. The prior is an uninformative prior on
a transformed scale of the two parameters. The
results obtained using the model described in
Gelman et al. (2004) are in fairly good agreement
with the results obtained by the model given earlier

5 Results for the Change from ye
to you
5.1 General remarks
As aforementioned, we have chosen the introduc-
tion of you to illustrate the Bayesian approach to the
investigation of the diffusion of linguistic changes.
Based on the CEEC and the Helsinki Corpus of
English Texts, Nevalainen and Raumolin-Brunberg
(2003) and Raumolin-Brunberg (2005) studied the
introduction of you by using the simple statistical
methods referred to in Section 3.1. According to
their findings, gender played a role after the
incoming form had reached the frequency of 20%,
women leading the change. No geographical origin
for the change was detected, but significant regional
differences emerged as the change progressed, the
capital area being more advanced than the rest of
the country. Informal spoken language seems to
have been the origin of this change, which allows us
to characterize it as a change from below in terms of
social awareness (Labov 1994, 78). As far as the
diffusion of the change in terms of social stratifi-
cation is concerned, Nevalainen and Raumolin-
Brunberg (2003) suggest that this change originated
in the middle ranks, merchants and professional
people, and spread from there to the upper ranks,
but not to the lower. The endorsement of you by
the upper ranks may in fact have been the factor
explaining the rapid supralocal diffusion of this
change.
5.2 Comparison of the different
approaches
We computed the pooling, averaging the averages,
and Bayesian estimates for all twenty-year periods
from 1410 to 1600, for the subgroups of females
and males, and for different regions, as well as for
different social classes. We omitted all subgroups
with less than four individuals. This resulted in
130 different subgroups. We analyzed each of these
using the bootstrap method for pooling and
averages of averages, and the Bayesian method
with C¼ 10.
The correlations between the different estimates
are very high, 0.97–0.99, the highest being the
correlation between the average of averages and
the Bayesian estimate. This is also visible in the
pairwise scatterplots of the three estimates for
these 130 groups, shown in Fig. 2. The correlations
are strongly influenced by the agreement of the
methods for the cases where the estimates are close
to 0 or close to 1. As can be seen from, e.g. the right
panel of Fig. 2, there is large variation for estimates
that are in the middle.
The widths of the confidence intervals are shown
in Fig. 3. In general, the differences are not large;
the Bayesian and averages of averages methods are
in better agreement than the Bayesian and pooling
or pooling and averages of averages.The mean width
of the posterior interval for the Bayesian method is
0.23, slightly larger than the mean width of the
confidence interval for pooling (0.19) and for
averages of averages (0.17). This is mainly due to
the subgroups with no occurrences of ye or you; as
mentioned, for such data sets the bootstrap
approaches yield estimates of 1 and a confidence
interval of width 0. For the eighty-five subgroups for
which both forms occur, the mean sizes of the
intervals are 0.24 for the Bayesian method, 0.27 for
the pooling approach and 0.24 for averages of
averages. The width of the Bayesian posterior
intervals is somewhat influenced by the choice of
the parameter C; setting C¼ 5 extends the mean
width of the posterior interval to 0.27 (all
subgroups) or 0.28 (subgroups in which both
forms occur).
5.3 Linguistic observations
Figure 4, showing the Bayesian estimate on gender
differences in the use of you and ye, confirms the
female leadership of this change, previously sug-
gested by simple methods of calculation. As regards
the different methods, Table 4 indicates in general
only minor differences between the approaches in
the analysis of women’s usage. In the case of men,
the three methods yield quite divergent results.
As an example, consider the periods 1500–19 and
1540–59. For 1500–19, pooling gives an estimate of
0.19 and the Bayesian approach only 0.04. The
reason is that a majority (seventeen out of twenty-
three) of the letter writers in the data set have not
used the feature at all; the few individuals with a
large number of occurrences of you do not offset the

effect of the majority. During the period that John
Johnson dominates, 1540–59 (Table 2), both
averaging and the Bayesian approach take into
account the differences in individual inputs, which
pooling cannot handle.
Figure 5, showing the Bayesian estimates for the
change in different regions, also confirms the
results of previous research. For the study of
regional variation in the CEEC, the usage in four
areas was compared (Nevalainen and Raumolin-
Brunberg 2003, 157–84). These were (1) the North
of England, comprising counties north of
Lincolnshire, (2) East Anglia, covering Norfolk
and Suffolk, (3) London, covering the city, its
suburbs and Southwark, and (4) the Court, less of
a geographical unit, which consists of the royal
family, courtiers and higher administrative officers,
many of whom lived in Westminster. The City of
London and the Court formed the capital area,
which had a large number of in-migrants and
weak-tie social networks, in other words, condi-
tions which are likely to promote language change.
For this article, the regional division was somewhat
simplified, in that we compared the capital region
(London, the Court and the Home Counties)
with the North and East Anglia. We also
contrasted the Capital region with the rest of the
country, consisting of the North, East Anglia, and
any data available from other regions in a given
period.

Figure 5 shows that, after 1500, the capital
region was in the lead when compared with the
North and East Anglia until 1560, when the
diffusion of subject you was practically com-
pleted. The comparison of the capital region
against the rest of the country yields slightly
different results, as there is a cross-over in 1540–
59, the other areas taking the lead. This graph
lends support to the concept of the snowball
effect (e.g. Ogura and Wang, 1996), according to
which the innovative form often spreads faster in
an area which adopts it later. It is noteworthy
that Table 5 indicates clear differences in the
estimates for 1540–59 in all the regions. In all
cases, pooling gives much lower estimates than
the other two methods.

Our material makes it clear that the new form
you was very rapidly diffusing among the popula-
tion in 1540–59. This type of rapid diffusion
typically involves extensive variation between indi-
viduals, including both those who strongly favor the
old form and those who prefer the new one, as well
as those who do not show categorical use of either.
In cases like this, striving for one single estimate for
all users may not be the best method to adopt.
6 Discussion and Conclusions
We have presented techniques for estimating the
frequency of alternative forms from small samples.
The basic maximum likelihood approaches are
pooling or averaging the averages; their confidence
intervals can be obtained by bootstrapping.
Bootstrapping is based on the idea of repeatedly
resampling the data, computing the frequency in the
sample, and inferring the confidence intervals from
the distribution of frequencies in the samples.
In the CEEC material used in our case study,
pooling seems to be less useful than averaging the
averages: pooling is susceptible to strong influence
by individuals with lots of data, and at least in the
CEEC data, results for averaging of averages seem to
behave in a more consistent manner. Bootstrapping
methods are very easy to implement and show
robust behavior. One of their drawbacks is that if
the data is very sparse, e.g. one of the forms is not
used at all, bootstrapping gives a confidence interval
of width 0, no matter how small the data is.

We also described a Bayesian model. The model
has a global parameter for the frequency, and an
individual parameter for each individual. Given the
probabilities of the individual parameter given the
global parameter, and the likelihood of particular
data for an individual given the individual param-
eter, the Bayesian method gives a posterior dis-
tribution of the frequency parameter. This posterior
distribution can then be used to obtain posterior
intervals for the global parameter. Bootstrapping
and Bayesian methods are especially useful when the
sample sizes are small, and hence more traditional
ways of determining confidence intervals cannot
be used. Bootstrapping and Bayesian methods can,
of course, also be used for large samples.
The Bayesian method is fairly easy to imple-
ment and gives robust results. The model looks at
individuals, allows for variation in individual fre-
quencies, and the amount of data that is available
from an individual does affect the result. In this
respect, one could say that the method is in
between pooling (which does not take individuals
into account) and averaging averages (in which
the amount of data from a person does not have
an effect).
The results we obtained for this case study
confirm our previous findings in that they show
how rapidly the second-person pronoun you
replaced ye in the subject function. The process
was completed in less than a hundred years, and the
better part of it took place in the first half of the
sixteenth century. The data provide us with clear
statistical confirmation that women were instru-
mental in spreading the incoming form in the most
rapid phase of the process in the sixteenth century.
As also shown by our earlier studies, the capital
region (London, the Court and the Home Counties)
clearly favored the incoming form in the first half of
the sixteenth century when compared with geogra-
phically more peripheral regions such as East Anglia
and the North. However, the Bayesian estimates also
suggest that, compared with the data available from
all other regions, the capital region was overtaken
and superseded by the rest of the country when the
change reached its mid-course in the 1550s. These
new findings agree with the basic principle sug-
gested by Ogura and Wang (1996) that localities
that are later in adopting an ongoing change will,
when it advances, not only catch up with those that
started earlier, but surpass them.
In these cases, bootstrap and Bayesian methods
have allowed us to assert findings based on small
samples with more confidence. They have also
helped us make some new discoveries. Equally
importantly, they have alerted us to cases where the
sample size is too small to allow statistical
inferencing.
One problem in the model we have described is
the dependence of the results on the parameter C
used to weigh the importance of deviations of

individual parameters from the global parameter.
Varying C does not typically have a strong impact
on the estimate of the frequency, but it does
influence the width of the posterior interval. On
the other hand, the Bayesian method gives reason-
able results even for extremely small sample sizes, as
it takes into account the prior information about
the global parameter.
All the methods considered in this article are
based on the assumption of one estimate of the
frequency of the form for each subgroup. This
might not be a valid assumption, however, and it
would be interesting to consider methods that
would search for possible components in the
sample. Techniques such as mixture modeling
could be useful in this regard.
In our sociolinguistic case study individual
informants form the basic unit. It goes
without saying that the methods introduced can
be applied to other types of linguistic material as
well; e.g. individual texts can be chosen as the
sampling unit.

1 The Corpus of Early English Correspondence (1998
version) was compiled by Jukka Kera¨nen, Minna
Nevala, Arja Nurmi, Minna Palander-Collin, and
the directors of the Sociolinguistics and Language
History project, Terttu Nevalainen and Helena
Raumolin-Brunberg. A sampler version of the corpus
(CEECS) is available from the Oxford Text Archive
(OTA; http://ota.ahds.ac.uk) and the International
Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English
(ICAME; http://helmer.aksis.uib.no/icame.html).
A tagged and parsed version of the corpus (PCEEC),
available from the Oxford Text Archive, was released
in 2006.
2 The quotations from the CEEC have a text identifier
consisting of the writer’s name, the year of writing, the
short title of the collection the letter comes from, and
a page number.
