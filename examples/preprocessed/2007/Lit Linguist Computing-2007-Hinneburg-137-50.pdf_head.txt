Abstract
Estimating the relative frequencies of linguistic features is a fundamental task in
linguistic computation. As the amount of text or speech that is available from a
given user of the language typically varies greatly, and the sample sizes tend to be
small, the most straightforward methods do not always give the most informa-
tive answers. Bootstrap and Bayesian methods provide techniques for handling
the uncertainty in small samples. We describe these techniques for estimating
frequencies from small samples, and show how they can be applied to the study
of linguistic change. As a test case, we use the introduction of the pronoun you as
subject in the data provided by the Corpus of Early English Correspondence
(c. 1410â€“1681).
