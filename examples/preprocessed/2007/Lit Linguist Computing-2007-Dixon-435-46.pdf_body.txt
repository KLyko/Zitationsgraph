
1 Introduction
The Busy Body, a thrice-weekly essay-journal, ran
from 9 October to 3 November 1759, a total of
twelve numbers. It has the mild distinction of
hosting the first of Goldsmith’s occasional essays,
a satirical description of London clubs which
reappeared, much enlarged, in Essays by
Mr. Goldsmith (1765). While a single authenticated
contribution does not in itself imply further con-
tributions, it does legitimately prompt further
investigations. In 1837 Sir James Prior proposed
Goldsmith as the author of the sixth number, an
essay both humorous and serious to which Prior
gave the title ‘On Public Rejoicings for Victory’.
He found no evidence of Goldsmith’s hand in the
rest of the journal (Prior, 1837, i, pp. 335–6). In his
edition of Goldsmith’s Collected Works, Arthur
Friedman supported Prior’s attribution; he too
saw no reason to admit any of the remaining ten
numbers to the canon.1
Meanwhile R.S. Crane had tentatively sug-
gested that Goldsmith might also have been
responsible for nos. IV and VIII (Crane, 1927,
pp. 125–7), and more recently John Ginger has
credited Goldsmith with no fewer than ‘ten pieces’
(Ginger, 1977, p. 130). Since Ginger does not
identify the pieces, his total may include the two
poems—‘The Logicians Refuted’ (in no. V) and
‘On the taking of Quebec’ (in no. II)—which are
doubtfully attributed to Goldsmith. Even so he is
giving Goldsmith the lion’s share of the contents.
As does Mary Anne Schofield: Goldsmith is the
‘chief contributor’ to the Busy Body, with four
essays which are ‘definitely’ his and five others
‘which share the same tone, moral philosophy,
and ideology’ (Schofield, 1983, p. 302). In his
comprehensive account of Goldsmith’s journalism
Richard C. Taylor likewise comments that ‘the
tone, narrative stance, and themes’ of the Busy Body
‘are strikingly similar to those of the Bee’,
Goldsmith’s own weekly miscellany, launched
just three days earlier (Taylor, 1993, p. 118).
Taylor accepts ‘Public Rejoicings’ as Goldsmith’s,
but wrongly states that it was reprinted in Essays
(1765). He also believes that Goldsmith was
contributing to the Busy Body in November 1759,
which would make him responsible for the two
final numbers (they are evidently by the same
hand), and though Taylor describes no. IV as
‘unattributed’, he appears to suggest that
Goldsmith could well be its author (Taylor, 1993,
pp. 84, 118). Perhaps Prior and Friedman were
over-cautious.

2 The Case for Goldsmith
Leaving aside no. III (the essay on clubs, certainly
by Goldsmith) and no. V, which consists of ‘The
Logicians Refuted’ and a set of prose parodies which
are not susceptible to the tests we propose to apply,
we have ten possible candidates for the canon. In the
complete absence of external evidence we can
support the candidature of these ‘doubtful’ essays
from internal evidence only. We look, therefore, for
clues in each of these ‘doubtful’ essays, especially
clues in the form of parallels of expression and idea.
But two general points may first be made:
(1) Goldsmith is a notorious self-plagiarist.
Echoes from one work to another are frequent
and frequently of great help to the attribu-
tionist. Arthur Friedman used them to good
effect. Yet, as he acknowledged, ‘certain
reviews known to be [Goldsmith’s] afford
no conspicuous parallels with his other works’
(Friedman, 1946, p. 24). The same is true of
the flippant essay on Theophilus Cibber
(Works, iii, pp. 46–8). To say, then, that a
piece of which Goldsmith is the putative
author has no parallels with his other
writings, is to make a purely neutral state-
ment. It does not (or should not) imply that
he may not have written it.
(2) The Busy Body and Goldsmith’s early writings
share a number of topical allusions. We
discount them as evidence because without
exception they are, in the words of the Busy
Body itself, part of ‘the general converse of
coffee-houses . . . and the chat of the tea-table’
(no. II, p. 7). They include the Elizabeth
Canning affair of 1753–54, the court-martial
and execution of Admiral Byng, the threat of
French soldiers invading England in flat-
bottomed landing-craft, and a couple of
well-known comic butts—Doctor Rock, the
self-promoting quack, and Jacob Henriques,
the self-styled patriot.
We turn now to the individual essays:
I. Mr Busybody’s boyhood; amusing conse-
quences of his meddlesome nature.
We can detect no evidence of Goldsmith’s
authorship; there are no parallels with his authentic
work in either thought or word.
II. Busybody’s early career among his London
neighbours and fellow-tradesmen.
Here, too, there is no positive evidence. The
phrase ‘a citizen of the world’ (p. 9) was well-
established before Goldsmith first used it in Polite
Learning (Works i, p. 291, and see ii, 16–17, nn.1
and 4).
IV. Busybody goes to France (where the natives
are as ‘restless and active’ as he), and twice lands
himself in prison, the victim of ‘despotick power’.
After quoting the account of Busybody’s second
arrest, and the description of his fellow-prisoners in
the Bastille, R.S.Crane comments: ‘The manner of
this is clearly not unlike Goldsmith’s. I should not
press the point, however, were it not that the
three French writers alluded to [Voltaire, Fre´ron,
the Chevalier d’Arcq] . . . had all been mentioned a
few months earlier in his Enquiry into the Present
State of Polite Learning and that Voltaire’s residence
in the Bastile [sic] had been described about the
same time in his ‘‘Memoirs of M. de Voltaire’’ ’
(Crane, 1927, pp. 126–7). Voltaire’s imprisonment
falls into the category of common knowledge.
Moreover, the Busy Body is correct in ascribing the
Journal e´tranger to Fre´ron (p. 23), whereas
Goldsmith had wrongly given it to d’Arcq (Works,
i, p. 289 and n. 3). It is possible that Goldsmith
checked his sources in the intervening six months.
It is perhaps more likely that the information has
a common source, which Goldsmith read rather
too hastily. We must respect Crane’s feeling that in
its ‘manner’ the piece resembles Goldsmith, but
we note that he did not press the point so far as
to reprint it as one of the New Essays by Oliver
Goldsmith.
VI. [‘Public Rejoicings for Victory.’]
Participating in the celebrations for the taking of
Quebec, Mr Busybody suffers damage to his wig,
observes joy in the coffee-houses, and advocates
moderate terms of peace.
Prior’s familiarity with Goldsmith’s works led
him to assert that this essay is ‘beyond doubt by
Goldsmith; it contains not only his sentiments . . .
but his manner, his humour, and even his unusual

phrases’ (Prior, 1837, i, p. 335). Judgements
based on sentiments and humour are not always
reliable, but ‘unusual phrases’ provide firmer
evidence. Prior pointed out that the phrase ‘may
this be my poison’, used here by the waiter at
Ashley’s Punch-house, occurs in ‘The Adventures
of a Strolling Player’, ‘The Haunch of Venison’,
and Letter 4 of The Citizen of the World.3 That same
letter also has an episode comparable to the scene
of the quarrelling shoemaker and his wife; the
phrasing is particularly close in the original version
of the ‘Chinese Letters’ in the Public Ledger.
Friedman adds a further parallel with The Citizen
of the World (Letter 17: the business of a victorious
army is to offer peace), and points to the
reappearance in The Traveller (at line 400) of the
image of ‘a flambeaux, the brighter it burns,
the sooner it is often wasted.’ He concludes, like
Prior, that these parallels put Goldsmith’s author-
ship ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ (Works, iii, p. 4).
VII. A letter from ‘Thomas Ubiquist’, a member
of the Busybody clan, describing his and his parents’
extremely active lives.
We can find no evidence for Goldsmith.
VIII. ‘The flat-bottomed Boats. A Vision.’ The
narrator’s dream of an enemy invasion is
the occasion for sharp satire of the French—their
religious superstition, foolish boasts, and poor diet
(the standard jokes about frogs and soup maigre)—
and warm praise of Britain (‘this land of liberty’)
and William Pitt.
The essay begins: ‘After the little excursion
mentioned in my last Paper, I returned home
full of those patriot thoughts with which I
concluded that Essay.’ A reference to the narrator’s
damaged peruke identifies ‘my last Paper’ as no. VI,
‘Public Rejoicings’. Crane suggests that this ‘may
perhaps be interpreted as an indication of common
authorship’ (Crane, 1927, p. 127). We may prefer to
interpret it as a narrative device, signalling that ‘Mr
Busybody’ has resumed the pen after the intervening
contribution from ‘Mr Ubiquist’. In any case, the
writer’s recollection is faulty: ‘Public Rejoicings’
begins with ‘patriot thoughts’ but quickly and
humorously undercuts the prevailing triumphalism,
and ends with sober exhortation: ‘Let victory be
attended by peace, for peace is the only triumph of
victory.’ There is nothing of any substance in
no. VIII to support an attribution to Goldsmith.
IX. Busybody’s unsuccessful attempts to make a
fortune, with incidental satire on the usual targets:
brokers, lawyers, and quacks.
No evidence for Goldsmith.
X. Busybody ‘pop[s] into a coffee-house’ and
reports the speeches of a group of ‘exotic figures’
who are in turn ridiculed by a group of ‘youngsters’.
Thus refreshed he visits a tavern with Thomas
Ubiquist, and meets a world-weary man whose
melancholy is dispelled by a good dinner.
There is nothing here to suggest the hand of
Goldsmith.
XI and XII. Two letters to the journal, signed by
one ‘T.O.’, who claims to be yet another kinsman.
Of the great variety of English character-types
he offers to describe three: ‘The odd Man. The
singular Man. The hippish Man’, but manages
only the first two. The odd man is represented by
‘Oakley Coothless’; Swift provides an example of
singularity.
These two pieces are in the Character tradition,
and employ (the first more than the second) the
terse sentences of such English character-writers as
Overbury, Webster, and Butler. Although this
minor genre is not represented in Goldsmith’s
authentic works, it is discussed in a review of
Butler’s prose writings which appeared two months
earlier in the Critical Review, and which Friedman
convincingly attributes to Goldsmith (Works, i,
pp. 206–12; Friedman, 1946, pp. 31–2). The
reviewer nominates Theophrastus as Butler’s
model, quotes approvingly from the character of
‘A Small Poet’, and gives that of ‘A Libeller’ almost
in its entirety. The recent publication of Butler’s
works (perhaps also the favourable review) may
have stimulated ‘T.O.’ to follow in his footsteps;
there is nothing more substantial to connect the two
letters to Goldsmith.
With the notable exception, then, of ‘Public
Rejoicings’, the evidence for Goldsmith’s authorship
of these essays is tenuous or non-existent.
Nevertheless, we shall be obliged to entertain at
least the possibility of his involvement if the manner
of writing, in any of the essays, can be shown
to be consonant with that displayed in his

early journalism. We need, therefore, to establish a
profile of Goldsmith’s style, from a study of aspects
of his vocabulary and of his grammatical and
syntactical practice, together with his preferences
in the matter of sentence-length.
3 Linguistic Features
We use the same forty samples, each of 750 words,
drawn from ‘genuine’ Goldsmith essays, which
formed the basis of our study of the Weekly
Magazine (Dixon and Mannion, 2007). In that
study, we set out the rules we adopted with regard
to repunctuating and modernizing the texts. We
chose 35 linguistic features (listed in Appendix A,
subsequently) and assembled the frequencies of
occurrence of these in each sample—the forty
Goldsmith samples, fifty-three control group sam-
ples from essays by eleven contemporary essayists,
and thirty-four Weekly Magazine doubtful samples.
The frequency scores for the Goldsmith samples are
displayed in Table B1, Appendix B. In the present
investigation the ten doubtful Busy Body essays,
some of which are over 2000 words long, yield
twenty-six samples, each of approximately 750
words:
s1, s2, s3 (No. I), s4, s5, s6 (II), s7, s8, s9 (IV), s10, s11
(VI), s12, s13 (VII), s14, s15, s16 (VIII), s17, s18 (IX), s19,
s20, s21 (X), s22, s23 (XI), s24, s25, s26 (XII).
The frequency scores for these samples are
displayed in Table B2, Appendix B; scores which
are not expressed as percentages have been scaled
in order to equalize the word-lengths of all the
samples.
Our analysis of the samples comes in two parts.
First we compare Goldsmith with the control
authors to evaluate the effectiveness of the features
in distinguishing between Goldsmith and the
controls, the basis of comparison being as described
in Dixon and Mannion, 2007. Table 4 of that article
(reproduced below as Table 1) shows the optimal
sets, Bq: the best q features to use in distinguishing
between Goldsmith and the controls, for each value
of q, q = 1, . . ., 35.
In the second part of the analysis, using only
those features which pass the test for effectiveness,
we calculate the distances of the doubtful
samples from the cluster of Goldsmith samples.
Those doubtfuls which are at a greater distance
from this cluster than we would expect for a
typical Goldsmith sample will be considered non-
Goldsmithian (i.e. significantly different from
Goldsmith).
For the sake of clarity and definiteness, it is
helpful to decide on the number of features to
include, using the following rule of thumb. Let
tq j = 1 if feature fj2 Bq; tq j = 0, otherwise, and let
tj ¼
Pp
q¼1 tq j . The value of tj indicates the effec-
tiveness of fj —the larger the value, the more
effective the feature. Our rule is to include fj if
tj  t , where t ¼ 1=35
P35
j¼1 tj (the average of the tj).
But t ¼ 18, and we see from Table 1 that just
eighteen features have tj 18 These are:
B ¼ f f1; f2; f4; f5; f6; f9; f11; f13; f15;
f18; f20; f21; f23; f25; f26; f28; f30; f31g:
We are reassured in our support of B in that it
agrees well with the optimal sets B17 B18 B19 .
Using only the score from B, let X=[xij] be
the n p matrix of the Goldsmith data, where
n = 40 and p = 18. Let x ¼ ð x1, . . . , xpÞ0, where
xk ¼ 1=n

that the sample is non-Goldsmithian—at the
5% level of significance. The values of F for the

twenty-six samples are Fm, m = 1, . . ., 26, where:
F1 ¼ 3:14; F2 ¼ 2:19; F3 ¼ 4:83; F4 ¼ 2:62;
F5 ¼ 0:90; F6 ¼ 1:47; F7 ¼ 1:21; F8 ¼ 1:90;
F9 ¼ 1:09; F10 ¼ 1:70; F11 ¼ 1:29; F12 ¼ 1:48;
F13 ¼ 2:70; F14 ¼ 4:18; F15 ¼ 3:27; F16 ¼ 2:58;

F21 ¼ 2:22; F22 ¼ 1:77; F23 ¼ 1:49; F24 ¼ 1:43;
F25 ¼ 1:47; F26 ¼ 2:17:
So samples s1, s2, s3, s4, s13, s14, s15, s16, s17, s19, s20,
s21, s26 (and possibly s18) are outliers to the
Goldsmith sample cluster, and relative to our set
of linguistic features should be considered as having
a non-Goldsmithian character.
For the present investigation we selected the
eighteen ‘best’ discriminatory features, B, from the
original thirty-five. However, on inspecting the
scores among the remaining seventeen, we noted
that f12, f22, f27, f29 produced scores for some of the
doubtful samples that were outside the range for
Goldsmith.

should be added to the collection of ‘good’ features

goes as follows. Suppose that a feature measures
‘colour of eye’ and that Goldsmith and each of
the control authors have eyes of a similar shade of
blue, then ‘colour of eye’ would be unlikely to be
included among the best set of features chosen to
discriminate between Goldsmith and the controls.
A doubtful author with eyes a very different shade
of blue from Goldsmith or the controls, or with
brown or green eyes, might then be mistaken
for Goldsmith if the eye colour test has been
excluded. Accordingly, we add these four features
to the previous eighteen tests and recalculate
the F-values (now with p = 22). A value of F >
2.16847 . . . will be significant at the 5% level of
significance. The values of F for the twenty-six
samples are Fm, m = 1, . . ., 26, where:
F1 ¼ 2:60; F2 ¼ 2:24; F3 ¼ 4:23; F4 ¼ 2:65;

F25 ¼ 1:87; F26 ¼ 2:58:

s14; s15; s16 (VIII); s17; s18 (IX); s19; s20; s21 (X);
s26 (XII)
are outliers to the Goldsmith sample cluster and
should be considered as having a non-Goldsmithian
character. These results provide strong evidence
against Goldsmith’s authorship of five essays: I, IV,
VIII, IX, and X, and cast some doubt on II, VII,
and XII.
4 Sentence-length
We use the measures of sentence-length established
in a previous paper where the measures for
Goldsmith were tested against fifty essays by his
contemporaries (Mannion and Dixon, 2004).
We omit Busy Body XI as a special case; the length
of its sentences is governed by the Character genre.
We include XII, however, since it relaxes the
discipline of that genre, and presents more anec-
dotal material.
Let G be the collection of Goldsmith samples
considered as a single essay. Let a0 = 0, a1 = 9,
a2 = 13, a3 = 17, a4 = 20, a5 = 24, a6 = 29, a7 = 36,
a8 = 200, and let Gk be the collection of sentences in
G that have lengths greater than ak 1 and less than
or equal to ak, k = 1, . . ., 8. The proportion of the
sentences in group Gk is pk, where p1 = 0.125,
p2 = 0.122, p3 = 0.135, p4 = 0.118, p5 = 0.118,
p6 = 0.137, p7 = 0.118, p8 = 0.127. For an essay S,
which we wish to compare with G, let Zk be the
number of sentences in Sk, k = 1, . . ., 8, where Sk is
the collection of sentences in S that have lengths
greater than ak 1 and less than or equal to ak,
k = 1, . . ., 8. Let N ¼
P8
k¼1 Zk be the number of
sentences in S. The statistic
X2 ¼
X8
k¼1
ðZk  NpkÞ2
Npk
is a measure of similarity between S and G. Suppose
that Y is a random variable distributed as a X2
random variable on 7 degrees of freedom, then the
probability that Y is >14.07 is 0.05. Thus, a value of
X2 > 14.07 is evidence—at the 5% level of signifi-
cance—against S being from the hand of
Goldsmith. The values of Zk and X
2 for the nine
essays (essay XI has been excluded) are displayed in
Table 2.
So, in terms of sentence length, all but VI, X, and
XII appear non-Goldsmithian. IV, with more longer
sentences than one might expect of Goldsmith, is a
borderline case—14.61 being only slightly more
than the critical value of 14.07.
With so much unfavourable evidence for the
majority of the essays, the possibility of Goldsmith’s
being the ‘chief contributor’ to the Busy Body begins
to look dubious. Consideration of another type of
evidence may strengthen our suspicions.

A doubtful text may express opinions and attitudes
which are at odds with those of its suggested author.
And it may contain idiosyncrasies of vocabulary and

our case would distinguish it from the work of
Goldsmith, always provided that any such idiosyn-
crasy is not influenced by content. The first two
numbers of the Busy Body, recounting the early
achievements of the meddling narrator, unsurpris-
ingly make much use of the words officious and
officiousness, with four occurrences in I, and three in
II. The fact that these content-dependent words are
absent from the Goldsmith samples is of no
consequence.4
(1) But the case is otherwise with considerable and
inconsiderable. These words occur four times
in Busy Body II, six times in IV, and three
times in IX, with one appearance in each of I
and X. In the forty Goldsmith samples we
have just two considerables, while a trawl
through the roughly 266,000 words which
Goldsmith produced between April 1757 and
November 1762 yields only eleven occur-
rences of the two words. The frequency rates
in Busy Body II, IV, and IX are, respectively,
1 in 594 words, 1 in 336, and 1 in 488.
For Goldsmith’s early writings the ratio is
1 : 24182. In short, three of the Busy Body
papers display a propensity for these words
which Goldsmith does not share.
(2) Equally striking is a fondness for the locution
‘not only . . . but likewise’. It is used four
times in I, twice in II, and once again in VIII.
There is not a single instance in our
Goldsmith samples: he follows ‘not only’
with ‘but even’, ‘but also’, or plain ‘but’.
(3) On occasion, the style of the Busy Body can
only be described as ponderous, an adjective
that can very rarely be applied to Goldsmith.
‘My positiveness, in some measure, over-
coming my father’s incredulity; he was
persuaded to receive that conviction of my
veracity by his sight . . .’ (I, p. 3); ‘An instance
or two of [Swift’s] singularity may not be
foreign to the present dissertation’
(XII, p. 69). As an admittedly rough-and-
ready way of quantifying this impression we
counted the number of words of four or more
syllables in each 750-word sample, excluding
proper nouns and ignoring inflections. To
achieve a comparison on reasonably equal
terms we omitted ‘The distresses of a
common Soldier’, where Goldsmith uses a
deliberately plain, unsophisticated vocabulary,
and the essays on education and pulpit
eloquence, which have a serious urgency
untypical of almost all the Busy Body pieces.
We were left with twenty-six Goldsmith
samples. The scores for these and the doubtful
samples are given in Appendix C. Seven of
the Busy Body samples have scores outside the
Goldsmith range: s2, s4, s9, s12, s17, s18, s20.
(4) We may also ask whether the political
opinions expressed in the doubtful essays are
shared by Goldsmith. In Busy Body I, William
Pitt, responsible as first minister for the
successful conduct of the war with France,
is simply ‘our great statesman’, but in VIII he
is praised as ‘our state Argus’, the ‘honestest
minister’ since Elizabethan times, possessing
‘a sagacity beyond applause’. The author
of XII announces that Pitt has ‘debarred

[the singular man] of the very power of
finding fault . . . and has forced him to join
with the whole nation in one combined
chorus of applause’. One ground for immedi-
ate doubt is that flattery was anathema to
Goldsmith. Another is his disapproval of
Pitt’s vigorous prosecution of a belligerent
policy which served commercial interests. The
disapproval is fully and sardonically registered
in Letter 17 of The Citizen of the World
(Works, ii, pp. 72–5) just six months after the
demise of the Busy Body. Three months later
the conclusion of Letter 50 gives a veiled but
unmistakable warning that ‘a minister of
merit and popularity’—who else but Pitt?—
could become an actual threat to his country,
were the king to give up even ‘the smallest
part of his prerogative to the people’ (Works,
ii, p. 213). In contrast to the adulation of Pitt
and his policies in Busy Body VIII and XII, the
narrator of ‘Public Rejoicings’ glories only
that ‘My king, my country, and I are friends
together’, and reproves those who, like Pitt,
see victory as an excuse to defer peace in the
expectation of further conquests. Without
naming the first minister (quite possibly a
deliberate omission) the author in effect
advises a change of policy. ‘Public
Rejoicings’ is in line with Goldsmith’s attitude
elsewhere; Busy Body VIII and XII are not.
6 Conclusion
Table 3 is a summary of our results. Evidence
against Goldsmith’s authorship is indicated by an
asterisk. The P-value is the probability of a score
greater than the observed score, assuming
Goldsmith as the author: the null hypothesis.

A P-value less than 0.05 is taken as evidence against
Goldsmith.
The weight of evidence against nos. I, II, and VIII
is such that we cannot accept Goldsmith as their
author. Nos. IX and X have several negative scores
which are not offset by any positive evidence:
we rate them as very unlikely to be Goldsmith’s.
The negative scores for nos. IV, VII, and XII
are fewer, but again there is nothing to tilt the
balance clearly in Goldsmith’s favour; our decision
is therefore ‘unlikely to be his’. No. XI is an
awkwardly borderline case; we can adduce neither
positive nor negative evidence. The fact that nos. XI
and XII constitute a single (though unfinished)
essay may tip the balance; they stand or fall together.
Since Goldsmith’s involvement in no. XII seems
unlikely—the idolizing of Pitt tells heavily against
it—we are inclined to pass the same verdict on its
companion piece. There remains only ‘Public
Rejoicings’: it has no adverse scores, while the
strong positive evidence—parallels of phrase, atti-
tude, and comic scene—moves it into the category
of ‘almost certainly by Goldsmith’.
We regret that our investigation has produced no
pleasant surprises. But there is at least a subdued
satisfaction in concluding that Prior and Friedman
were correct in their assessment of Goldsmith’s
limited but not insignificant contribution to the
Busy Body.
