Until now, non-traditional authorship attribution
techniques have hardly been applied to medieval
texts. The fact that we do not and probably
never will know the author of many texts, may
play a role in this. There are cases, however, in
which the researcher does not necessarily want to
identify a specific author but wishes to distinguish
one (perhaps anonymous) author from another.
In these cases, it could indeed be very interesting
to turn to modern authorship attribution tech-
niques and find out of how much help they actually
can be.
In our research on medieval Dutch literature, we
have long been intrigued by a Middle Dutch
Arthurian romance that seems to be the perfect
case for an experiment like this. In this article, we
first present the case and the questions we started
out with (Section 2). We then summarize our first
results and present the new questions to which
these lead (Section 3). In Section 4, we investigate
two specific questions. We then focus on the
possibilities of Burrows’s Delta for distinguishing
the authors as well as the scribes of Walewein
(Section 5). After presenting our results, we sum up
our conclusions and describe how we plan to test
our results and to refine the method we are
developing.
2 The Case: Roman van Walewein
One of the few Middle Dutch romances that were
not translated from Old French is the Arthurian
romance known as Walewein or Roman van
Walewein (‘Romance of Walewein’). The main
character of this verse text in rhyming couplets is
Arthur’s nephew Walewein—the ‘Gawain’ of
English texts and the ‘Gauvain’ of the French.
Walewein was probably written around the year
1260, but the only surviving complete manuscript
dates from almost a century later. The manuscript
was written by two scribes. The first wrote lines

1–5,783 and the second—who stated that the job
was finished in 1350—lines 5,784–11,202 (van Es,
1957, 2: p. 403). Apart from the complete manu-
script, there are two extant fragments of another
manuscript from roughly the same time, which
together contain almost 400 lines of text. The digital
file we used for our research was based on van Es’s
edition (van Es, 1957, 1).2
The narrator of the text states that the romance
was written by two authors. Penninc started the
text3 but did not finish it, much to the regret of
Pieter Vostaert, who decided to pick up on the
story. At the end of the work, the narrator tells
his audience that Vostaert has added ‘about’
3,300 lines to Penninc’s work.4 Exactly when
Vostaert added the end to the story is uncertain;
this could be relatively shortly (a few years at the
most) after Penninc’s writing around 1260, or after
a much longer time period. Theoretically, it would
be possible that Vostaert wrote his text shortly
before (or in) 1350, the year in which the manu-
script was finished. Researchers up till now favoured
the first option and have not seriously taken the
second possibility into account.
The structure of the story is presented in Fig. 1.
Several Walewein researchers have presented their
opinion about the exact place in the text where
Vostaert took over from Penninc. The text has
11,202 lines. The prologue comprises the first
32 lines, the epilogue lines 11,173–11,198. The last
four lines are an addendum by the second scribe,
who dates his work to the year 1350. Vostaert may
have added the prologue or reworked it.5 We do
not know whether he included these 32 lines in
his ‘about 3,300’ lines. In fact, it is even uncertain
whether the manuscript from 1350 contains the
same number of lines as the supposed manuscript
that Vostaert himself completed. For the sake
of convenience, however, we started from the
hypothesis that changes in this respect were
relatively minor.
It is possible that Vostaert added lines at several
places in the text, although none of our predecessors
seems to have thought of that possibility. However,
we think it is highly implausible that Vostaert
would then have been able to estimate that he had
added about 3,300 lines. Because he mentions such
a number and discusses his work as ‘continuing’

a work that ‘lacked a conclusion’, we begin with
the hypothesis that he added most of his work after
the text of Penninc. We think that Vostaert
estimated how many lines he had contributed by
counting how many folia he had added and multi-
plying this figure by the mean number of lines he
wrote on a page. To delineate the area in which
Vostaert supposedly took over (Fig. 2), we calculated
the number of lines for two possibilities, namely that
Vostaert included the prologue and the epilogue in
the 3,300 lines, and that he did not include them.
This yields the lines 7,872 and 7,930, respectively,
as the area around which Vostaert’s work starts.6
In the story outline, this area is part of
episode number 7, which tells of Walewein’s arrival
at the castle where the princess lives, and describes
the fights he has to engage in to get into the castle
and then out of it again.
The first editor of Walewein—W. J. A.
Jonckbloet—pointed to line 7,835 as the place
where Vostaert ‘roughly’ started his work
(Jonckbloet, 1846–1848, 2: p. 303). He based this

assumption on the usage of loan words, which
clearly differs from one part of the text to the
other (Jonckbloet, 1846–1848, 2: p. 182). In 1936,
Maartje Draak in her dissertation on the structure of
Walewein as being derived from a well-known folk-
tale, argues for the takeover happening at line 7,840
or 7,843. She does so based on the first occurrence
of ‘a typical Vostaert word’ in line 7,844 as terminus
ad quem and of ‘a typical Penninc rhyme’ in lines
7,837–7,838 as terminus a quo (Draak, 1936,
pp. 205–6). The second editor of the complete
text—G. A. van Es—quotes the opinions of his
predecessors and states that it is not possible to
pinpoint the exact location, because it is entirely
plausible that Vostaert edited the last lines of
Penninc’s text. He thus suggests that the break
occurred somewhere between the lines mentioned
by Jonckbloet and Draak (i.e. lines 7,835–7,842).
He proposes that these lines may have been partly
rewritten by Vostaert on the basis of Penninc’s lines,
and continues by presenting an overview of the
differences between both authors (more on that in
Section 4). In a study of the Middle Dutch
Arthurian romance Ferguut, our colleague Willem
Kuiper—one of the few researchers of Middle Dutch
to use quantitative methods—states that based on
spelling variants, Vostaert took over from Penninc
at line 7,835 (Kuiper, 1989, p. 245 n. 84).
In 2001, a totally new interpretation was put
forward by A. M. Duinhoven (2001, pp. 57–60),
who states that it would not be logical to look for the
author change in the area around line 7,840.
As mentioned, these lines are in the middle of a
long and coherent text episode, and this fact and
the differences between the two authors as presented
by earlier researchers do not convince Duinhoven.
He disqualifies their choice for the area around line
7,842 as being the result of a silly miscalculation: they
obviously subtracted 3,330 lines from 11,172 in stead
of 3,300. Duinhoven’s new solution is to assume a
transcription error in the lines in which Vostaert
mentions the number of lines he has added. A scribe,
Duinhoven states, incorrectly transcribed the origi-
nal ‘three hundred and thirty lines’ as ‘thirty-three
hundred lines’. Thus, Duinhoven considers line
10,872 (11,202 minus 330) as the place where the
author changeover occurred. He argues that the text
has a logical break at this place, as there it is written
that ‘Of this I shall say no more, rather I shall
continue the story for you’ (10,872–10,873, Johnson
and Claassens, 2000, pp. 481).
3 First Experiments
Our first question was a bold one: could we, by
making use of quantitative, non-traditional author-
ship attribution techniques, find the exact place
where Vostaert took over from Penninc and prove
which of our predecessors was right? In choosing
between the most well-known authorship attribu-
tion techniques, we were guided by our wish to
follow-up on measurement results with research on
word and sentence level, resulting in stylistic
descriptions of the differences between the two
authors. We believe that this is a good way not only
to gain an insight into the craft of authors but also
to discover more about how the techniques really
work and what they actually measure. In addition,
it is a way to evaluate the soundness of our
approach and can therefore help us to refine the
methods.7
To be able to present stylistic descriptions based
on measurement results, the unit of information
yielded by the measurements should fit the logic of
philology. For our purposes, the most useful unit of
information is (at least, at the moment) the word.
We could compare authors by looking at the lexical
preferences their work shows. We could group
words, abstracting from word preferences to
emphasized concepts, and through these perhaps
in due time also themes or motifs, and we could
show other scholars exactly how we do that: our
work could be checked and repeated by others.
Thus, in view of our present goals, very useful
techniques that measure strings but neglect word
boundaries do not qualify.
Our wish to be able to look for words, concepts,
etc. also resulted in our decision to lemmatize the
complete text and consequently base our measure-
ments on the lemma’s (headwords). To give an
example: the Middle Dutch word for ‘sword’ occurs
in different spellings in Walewein: swert, swart (both
uninflected) as well as in inflected forms like swerde,
swerden and swarde, swarden. All these different

word forms denote the same word. Because we have
chosen to research vocabulary and not spelling we
have to tag each occurrence with the same head
word—modern Dutch ZWAARD in this case. But
the word forms swert and swart are also used as the
adjective ‘black’, so these occurrences need to be set
apart from all the ‘sword’s with another headword,
ZWART. And to complete the picture: the word
form swert is used once as an enclitic form of the
first person singular in the present tense of the verb
sweren ‘to swear’ and the pronoun dat. So this word
form gets two headwords: ZWEREN and DAT.
We tagged every word form (token) with the
appropriate headword (type). For inflected nouns,
adjectives, and pronouns, this is the nominative
form, while for conjugated verb forms, this is the
infinitive form of the verb. Furthermore, all spelling
variants were normalized in the headword using as a
guideline the modern Dutch spelling (or the spelling
the word would have had, had it survived in our
current vocabulary). See Fig. 3 for an example.
Lemmatizing the text is a first interpretation of the
material. However, as we mentioned, the tagging of
the unit of the word (here, the type) is necessary to be
able to talk or write in a comprehensible way about
the material or the results of the measurements. To
return to the example given earlier: lemmatization
makes it possible for us to make statements about
how many times the word ZWAARD ‘sword’ is used
in whatever spelling, and how often the word
ZWART ‘black’, etc. It creates the opportunity to
say something about authors’ preferences for certain
words instead of for certain spellings that may be
used for altogether different words.8
We developed a web application that enabled us
to semi-automatically tag the text. This application
(called Autonom) generates a frequency list for a
given text. Subsequently, any word form in the
frequency list can be annotated by multiple tags and
properties. The work of annotating is conveniently
facilitated through the web interface, which obviates
the need to use laborious and potentially error-
prone handcrafted XML. Annotations and annota-
tion properties for each user are stored as separate
stand off XML hierarchies to support multiple views
and interpretations of the text by different
researchers.9
For our first experiments, we decided to use
Udny Yule’s Characteristic K to measure lexical
richness and Burrows’s Delta to examine significant
differences in the use of high frequency words
throughout Walewein. In order to be able to detect
any changes in the course of the text, we devised a
walking window of 2,000 lines moving in one-line
steps through the text. We measured Yule’s K or
Burrows’s Delta as shown in Fig. 4.
We used the formula for Yule’s K, shown in
Fig. 5.10
Yule’s K measures the amount of word repetition in
a text: the higher the K is, the more the repeti-
tion; the lower the K is, the richer the vocabulary.
Applying this formula in walking window
fashion yielded the results presented in Fig. 6,
which for every line shows the difference between
Yule’s K in the 1,000 lines before and the 1,000 lines
after that line.
Figure 6 represents only the area in Walewein in
which we would expect to find the author change,
although we did of course do measurements for the
complete text (more about Yule in Section 4).
Suffice it to say, the measurements did not yield any
sign of significant changes in the final part of the
text, which means that this approach neither
confirmed nor repudiated Duinhoven’s opinion
that Vostaert took over from Penninc at line
10,872. In the area shown in Fig. 6, however, there
is a clear, inverted arch-like trend that is broken by

a localized peak around line 7,880. This may
indicate the place where the author change took
place, so we kept this in mind during the subsequent
measurements. Comparable localized peaks were
not found in any other part of the text.
Yule’s K for the parts of the text before and after
line 7,880 differ a lot, as is shown in Fig. 7. Penninc
repeats words less often, which means that his
lexicon is richer and his wording more elaborate.
The difference is statistically significant.
In his Busa Award presentation and in two
later articles, John Burrows introduced and detailed
what he named the ‘Delta procedure’ (Burrows
2002, 2003). This method is an attempt to identify,
with some degree of confidence, authorship in ‘open
games’ (i.e. cases in which there is little or no text-
external evidence to guide researchers to likely
candidates). In such cases, one can only try to
identify likely authors from a large set or database of
texts or textual features.
The Delta procedure is based on a comparison of
the differences between the frequencies of the most
frequent words in a set of texts, and the frequencies
of those words in the text we are trying to attribute to
authors represented by texts in the set. The first step
in the process is to compute the overall mean token
frequencies for a large set of texts. By computing
z-scores, these mean frequencies can then be
compared with the frequencies of the same tokens
in a test text and also with the frequencies of these
tokens in the subset of texts of a particular author
represented in the main text database. Thus, for each
frequency the difference from the overall mean
frequency is expressed by a number of standard
deviations for that frequency in the main set. This
gives us two z-scores for each frequency: one for the
frequency of the token in the test text, and one for
the frequency of the same token in the subset of
a given author in the main set. Subsequently, the
absolute difference between the two z-scores is

computed for all frequencies. Finally, the mean of
these absolute differences gives us ‘Delta’ for the
test text, that is, a unitary measure that provides us
with an indication of how far apart the token
frequencies lie that are characteristic of the test text
and the frequencies that are characteristic of all the
combined text of a certain author in the main set.
The lower the Delta value for a test text, the
higher the possibility that both the test text and the
subset of texts within the main set to which it is
compared were written by the same author. Thus, if
the Delta ‘between’ a certain test text and the subset
of a given author in the main set has a low value,
we attribute the text to that author. However,
if none of the test texts scores a value for Delta that
is significantly lower than the delta computed for all
other test texts, we consider the possibility that the
actual author of the test text was not represented
within the main set of texts.
The Delta procedure is grounded in the avail-
ability of a large set of texts of considerable length
representing a pool of authors from which a likely
candidate may be selected. In our case, we do not
have such a set at our disposal because of the
scarceness of known Middle Dutch authors and the
lack of other texts that can be ascribed to Penninc
or Vostaert. We, therefore, had to devise a testing
environment enough like the Delta procedure to
be able to apply Delta to the Walewein text. It may be
that the specific nature and design of this environ-
ment overstretches the feasible application of
Delta. In addition, because of the scarce nature
of our material (about 68,000 tokens) we have only
a feeble statistical basis on which to build.
Nevertheless, we thought that it might be interesting
and possibly insightful to do some ‘Delta work’ on
Walewein.
To devise some kind of text database from our
68,000 or so tokens, we developed an application
that is able to base a main set on a given division
of the main text. The number of divisions can be
chosen arbitrarily, but to resemble the testing
environment and text sizes Burrows used we chose
to divide the main text into parts each comprising
12,000 tokens, which gave us just five ‘texts’ of
12,000 tokens and a smaller ‘text’ of 7,946 tokens as
our main set. We instructed the application to select
a specific portion of the main text as the ‘subset’
of texts from either Penninc or Vostaert for Delta
comparison. The application can walk a sliding
window through the text line by line and, given
a certain subset of the text as a comparison base, can
compute a Delta for each window of text. We can
arbitrarily size the window to contain as many or
as few lines as we want. For the set of tests we ran
for this contribution, we chose to use window sizes
of between 1,000 and 2,000 lines. Cf. Fig. 8 for
a schematic explanation.
We took measurements in this way throughout
the text. We used two different parts of the text as
the ‘subset’ to which we compared each window of
2,000 lines. The first set of measurements compared
the frequencies of the 150 most frequent words in
the 3,000 lines of subset text from Penninc (i.e. lines
1,000–4,000) (Fig. 9). The second set took lines
8,000–11,000 as the subset, as according to Vostaert
and most previous researchers they were almost
certainly written by the second author. Line 8,000 is
well after the area in which we would expect the
author change, so this part of the text is supposed
to function as a relatively stable representation of
Vostaert’s work (Fig. 10). Both figures present the
results through the complete text and mark the
location of line 7,880, which we found to be
significant in our measurement of lexical richness
with Yule’s K.
Figure 9, in which part of Penninc’s text is used
as the basis for the measurements, is difficult to
analyse. With part of Vostaert’s text as a subset,
however, the measurements yield a clearer picture.
In Fig. 10, there are clearly two levels of Delta in the
text, which meets our expectations: we assume the
author change to have occurred somewhere halfway
down the sloping line. This agrees more or less with
what the measurements of Yule’s K yielded, namely
that the change takes place somewhere around line
7,880. Figure 11 presents both graphs superim-
posed; the lines for both measures cross at about
line 7,147. At this point in the text, there is no clear
break in the story.11
However, these measurements do not help us to
pinpoint the exact location in the text. We do not
have enough information to give credit to one
of our predecessors as being right about the

line(s) where Vostaert took over from Penninc.
Although our first question was too bold, the
measurements did provide us with enough informa-
tion to examine the possible differences between the
two authors.
For the time being, we focused on line 7,880 as
the break, assuming that Penninc’s influence is
uppermost before that line and Vostaert’s after it.
We then surveyed the vocabulary of the text before
and after line 7,880 and generated a list of words
that were used significantly more by Penninc
and significantly more by Vostaert, respectively.
We arranged them in order of significance, with the
word with the highest significance for each author at
the top (Table 1).
The list in Table 1 gives rise to some interesting
observations. As to the methodological aspect, the
word at the top of Penninc’s list shows that we
would also need tagging for part of speech, as the
lemma ‘zijn’ is homophonous: it denotes either a
form of the verb ‘to be’ or a form of the possessive
pronoun ‘his’. Of course we would want to know for
which of these Penninc has a predilection (if any,
after disambiguating them). Tagging for part of
speech would be necessary in order to be able to
distinguish the different functions of ‘zijn’ in a list

like this (but a PoS tagger for Middle Dutch is not
yet available).
Apart from that, the first thing we noticed is that
Penninc makes significantly more use of first- and
second-person personal pronouns, in contrast to
Vostaert’s significantly greater use of the third
person. Penninc also uses many modal verbs. But
why? Are there several reasons for these differences,
or can all be explained by only one or two ‘special
effects’ of the individual authors? In 1957, van Es
mentioned that Penninc uses more dialogue than
Vostaert. Could that be the explanation for the
statistical differences between the two authors for
the pronoun differences and those in the modal
verbs (expected to be used more in dialogue than in
otherwise narrated text)? This guided us back to the
work of van Es and the differences he found based
on a selection of quantitatively analysed lexical
elements.
4 Dialogue and Court versus
Sword
For the introduction to his edition of Walewein in
1957, van Es made use of quantitative research on a
select group of lexical and grammatical items
conducted by G. S. Overdiep at the beginning of
the twentieth century and reported on in his
masters thesis (van Es, 1957, 2: p. 344). This
research compared the usage of the selected items in
the text parts of Penninc and Vostaert. As
mentioned, van Es assumed that Vostaert reworked
the last lines of Penninc’s text and assumed that
Vostaert’s work starts to be visible in the range of
lines 7,835–7,842. The items on which van Es
reports concern rhyme words, some syntactical
aspects, usage of past perfect and historical present
tense and the differences in their frequencies at the
end of the line and/or in the line, usage of adverbs,

and aspects of the vocabulary used by Penninc and
by Vostaert, especially the frequencies of loan words
of French origin. In addition, van Es investigated the
preferences of both authors for certain scenes in the
story (van Es, 1957, 2: pp. 341–72). In a concluding
section, van Es presents a short description of the
character of both authors and the relationship he
assumes between them. He describes Penninc as
calm, deliberate, contemplative, elaborate in his
wording, focused on courtly details and as using a
lot of dialogue, while he describes Vostaert as
tempestuous, passionate, and focused on action,

especially on fights. Van Es assumed that these
differences could be accounted for by the age
difference between the two authors and by their
possibly different backgrounds (e.g. working in
different regions or at different courts). Van Es
thinks that Penninc was older than Vostaert, but
believes that they must have known one another
(van Es, 1957, 2: pp. 372–3). This implies that van
Es dates Vostaert’s work not very long after
Penninc’s.
Based on the list of lexical preferences in the two
parts of the text as presented at the end of Section 3,
we decided to investigate two aspects. The first was
the dialogue: could we confirm van Es’s remark that
Penninc made more use of dialogue than Vostaert
did, and would this help us to largely explain the
results of our measurements of lexical richness and
of Delta? The second question we wanted to answer
was whether van Es was indeed right in his intuition
that Penninc was more elaborate in his courtly
scenes, and Vostaert more elaborate when there was
any fighting to be done.
We tagged the text for dialogue, marking direct
and indirect speech as well as narrated monologue
(erlebte Rede). Because the last two occur only
very occasionally, we grouped all three types of
speech together to get an idea of the amount of
dialogue both authors use. We again used line
7,880 as the point of division. We measured two
things: the mean number of words used in dialogue
and the mean number of clauses. By a ‘clause’ we
mean a set of words spoken or thought by a
character in the text surrounded by words of the
narrator or author. Thus, if a character’s speech
is interrupted once by such a phrase as seit hi
(‘he said’), we counted two clauses. For these
measures we also used a walking window, this time
of only 1,000 lines.
Figure 12 presents a graph showing the percen-
tage of words in dialogue of the text for a 1,000-line
window.
This graph has a significant peak around the
line where the change of copyists takes place.
However, there is another explanation for this:
lines 5,328–5,805 contain the long monologue by
the fox Roges telling Walewein his life story.
That this must be the reason for the peak
becomes clear when we look at the graph presented
in Fig. 13, which shows the number of clauses for
the 1,000-line walking window.
Neither of these two figures reveals a significant
difference either in the mean number of words or in
the number of clauses in dialogue between the two
parts of the text. Bar charts totalling the numbers
for both parts provide some more insight. Figure 14
presents the mean percentage of words used
for dialogue in every 1,000 lines for both parts,

window’ of 1,000 lines of text was used, calculating the

and Fig. 15 the mean number of clauses used per
1,000 lines for both parts.
We conclude from these graphs that Penninc
uses more words in dialogue in about the same
number of clauses. Thus, Penninc seems to be more
elaborate in his wording than Vostaert is, or/and he
uses dialogue for other purposes than Vostaert does,
for example, for long monologues, such as the one
by the fox Roges. This is not the place, however, to
go into this more deeply. It will be clear, though,
that van Es’s remark that Penninc’s part contains
substantially more dialogue cannot unambiguously
be confirmed by our measurements.
Our second question concerns the contrast
that van Es saw between ‘court’ (Penninc) and
‘sword’ (Vostaert). Could it be that Penninc is more
elaborate than Vostaert when he writes about scenes
in courtly surroundings, and could Vostaert use
more words for fight scenes than Penninc does?
To measure this, we tagged the text for scenes that
take place at a castle and for fight scenes. As these
two types of scenes can occur at the same place in
the text, we defined a court scene as starting at the
moment Walewein enters a castle (or a pavilion in
which a lord and his retinue are temporarily
staying) and ending when he departs from that
castle or pavilion, and a fight scene as starting
with the first physically hostile act committed by
Walewein or his adversary (regardless of who is
‘right’) and ending when one of the fighting parties
surrenders, is taken prisoner, or dies. Both the first
part of the text (up to line 7,880) and the second
part (from line 7,880 onwards) contain the starts of
seven court scenes. The first part contains nine fight
scenes, while the second part has six.
We measured the number of words used for
court scenes in the first and in the second part of the
text and for the fight scenes in both parts. The
measurements for both types are given in Fig. 16.
Per type, the darker bar on the left gives the results
for the first part of the text (Penninc) and the
lighter bar on the right gives those for the second
part (Vostaert).

Per type of scene, the graph shows only a small
difference between the two parts of the text. The
authors are comparable in their attention to both
‘court’ and ‘sword’ when we look at the number of
words. The maximum amount of distinguishable
difference is that Penninc uses about 3.6% fewer
words for fight scenes than Vostaert does. Put in
other terms: of every hundred words, Vostaert
devotes less than four words more to fighting than
Penninc does, which is not a very notable difference.
If we look at the authors separately, Vostaert
pays just a little less attention—1.4 words less in
every hundred words—to ‘court’ than to ‘sword’,
while Penninc uses 3.0 words less in every hundred
words for ‘sword’ than for ‘court’. The overall
differences are minimal, though, and do not
confirm the significant differences that van Es
thought he detected.
Because we wanted to know a little bit more
about the way Penninc and Vostaert described court
scenes and fight scenes (can we again say something
about the possible elaborateness of Penninc com-
pared with Vostaert?), we used Yule’s K to measure
the lexical richness of court and fight scenes in both
parts of the text. This led to the bar charts shown
in Fig. 17.
It is certainly interesting to see that Penninc’s
court scenes contain less repetition and thus have a
higher lexical richness than Vostaert’s court scenes
do. This may explain why van Es thought that he
detected a larger attention for court scenes on
Penninc’s part. But we see a different picture when
there is fighting involved: the lexical richness is more
or less the same for both authors. This is contrary to
what van Es thought he had seen. When we look at
the bars representing Vostaert’s text part, we even see
that his work shows more word variation in court
scenes than in fight scenes. This is highly unexpected,
seen from van Es’s point of view.
Both the subject of dialogue and of a possible
difference in preference for court scenes or fight
scenes need to be investigated further. For the goal we
have set ourselves for this article, however, the results
of our measurements seem to show that van Es’s
intuitions proved to be difficult to support
with statistically significant measurement results.
Above all, the elements we looked at gave us no help
in finding out in what exact ways Penninc and
Vostaert differ: they do not seem to explain the
majority of the differences in vocabulary concerning
pronouns and modal verbs. In addition, the results of
the measurements do not provide clues regarding in
which direction to look for them.12 We, therefore,
returned to Burrows’s Delta, hoping to discover as to
which part of the vocabulary of both the authors
reveals most effectively how the two differ.
5 A Delta Procedure Analysis of
Walewein
Delta is primarily an author-distinguishing measure
based on differences in the usage of high frequency
words by authors. Thus, it is to be expected that two
texts written by two different authors will show
differing values for Delta. Because Walewein has
always been assumed to have been written by two
authors, we predicted that we would find two
roughly stable but distinctly different values for the
parts of the text written by each of the two authors.
If we were to plot a graph depicting the value of
Delta for each text window of, for example,
a thousand lines at any given point in the text
of Walewein (comparing it with part of Vostaert’s
text), we would expect it to look something like the
graph in Fig. 18. Thus, we would expect to find two

court scenes for the parts of the text before and after line
7,880 and for the complete text. Darkest bars: first part

consistent Delta values that would slide over into
each other around the line where we suspect the
change of authors took place (i.e. at line 7,880).
Indeed this is what we found as a result of our
preliminary experiments described in Section 3
(cf. Fig. 10). In his critical examination of
Burrows’s Delta, David Hoover shows that Delta is
not only quite apt at distinguishing authorship,
but that taking into account an increased number
of high-frequency words, it does the job even better
(Hoover, 2004). Indeed, repeated tests with an
ever larger number of high-frequency words (up to
the 150th ranking word) showed that the graph in
Fig. 10 became increasingly clear-cut, with two
increasingly stable values for Delta and the expected
drop of the Delta value stable around line 7,880.
As pointed out in the previous section, however,
we are interested in the Delta procedure as a means
not only of distinguishing between authors, but also
of telling us more about the qualitative differences
between the vocabulary of Penninc and Vostaert.
For that reason, we wanted to know which part of
the high-frequency vocabulary discriminated most
clearly between both the authors, or in other words:
could Delta perhaps guide us to the set of high-
frequency words that most clearly set Penninc apart
from Vostaert? Supposedly the study of that part of
the vocabulary of both the authors would reveal
content-related, thematic, and/or stylistic differ-
ences between the work and methods of Penninc
and Vostaert.
Hence, we decided to run a series of tests in which
we used consecutive subsets of the high-frequency
vocabulary to calculate Delta. We hypothesized that
the Delta graph for each subset would closely
resemble the overall view found in Fig. 10, and we
expected that the graph for the most discriminating
subset would have the largest drop between other-
wise rather stable Delta values for Penninc’s part on
the one hand and Vostaert’s part on the other.
First, we computed a Delta graph based on only
the fifty most frequent words (Fig. 19). Rather
contrary to our expectations, the most prominent
feature of this graph is the peak around line number
6,000. We quickly discerned that this peak coincides
closely with the change of scribes that takes place
around that line (cf. Section 2 of this article).
Extensive application of the Delta procedure to
other situations where a change of scribe is known
could further test this finding.
Figure 20 shows the Delta graph we computed
for the top 100 through 150 most frequently used
words. We found that the measurements for the
range of the 100 through 150 highest frequency
words fitted closest with our predictions. We,
therefore, think that a closer look at the lexicon
that is defined by this frequency range will reveal
the most telltale differences between Penninc and
Vostaert. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of

this subset of the high-frequency vocabulary will be
part of our further research.
By far the most intriguing graph was produced
when we took the Delta measurement for the range
of 50 through 100 highest frequencies (Fig. 21).
Again we found high Delta values for Penninc and
lower Delta values for Vostaert. The peak character-
ized as an indication for a change of scribe in the
first graph (Fig. 19) is again visible. Interestingly, a
close look reveals a plateau just before line 7,880
(where Vostaert supposedly took over from
Penninc). Here we find a rather constant value for
Delta for about 400 lines. The value is almost exactly
halfway between Penninc’s and Vostaert’s ‘plateaus’.
It is very tempting to think of this short halt in the
freefall of Delta from Penninc’s rather stable value
to Vostaert’s rather stable value as a part of the text
that was originally written by Penninc and later
adapted by Vostaert. It might be the case that we see
Vostaert at work creating the transition from the
already existing text into his own work.13 As we are
particularly interested in the way the styles of
writing of both authors differ, it will be interesting
to follow-up the Delta procedure analysis of the
complete text of the Walewein with a closer analysis
of the vocabulary of the parts that are undisputedly
attributed to either Penninc or Vostaert. But given
this intriguing result and for exactly the same reason
it will be most interesting to see in what ways the
vocabulary of this specific part differs from the parts
adjoined to it.
6 Conclusions and Next Steps
The most important result of our experiments is
that at least in Walewein we seem to be able to
distinguish scribes as well as authors by using
Burrows’s Delta for different sets of word frequen-
cies. Measurements of the group of fifty words with
the highest frequencies clearly point to the paleo-
graphically visible change of scribe in Walewein.
The frequencies from the range of 100–150 give the
sharpest visualization of the change of authors.
And perhaps we even can point out the area where
the work of the first author was edited by the second
one: the frequencies 50–100 result in a third level in
the text, distinct from the copyist and the author
change and at the place in the text between the two
distinguishable authors. This seems a confirmation
of van Es’s suggestion that Vostaert edited the
last lines of Penninc before starting out ‘on his
own’, although the number of edited lines our
measurements might indicate is much higher,
namely about 400 rather than only eight lines.

As of yet, it is uncertain whether the measures are
seemlessly applicable to other texts. We are
currently planning new research projects to test
the measures on other texts that were written by
more than one copyist and/or more than one
author, and on different Middle Dutch texts that
were written by the same scribe. To give a few
examples: we will select episodes from Jacob van
Maerlant’s Middle Dutch verse translation of the
medieval Latin Historia scholastica and compare the
vocabulary of these episodes in the fifteen different
manuscripts that have come down to us. This may
lead to more knowledge about what kind of lexical
freedom different scribes allowed themselves in this
genre—the next step would of course be to compare
this with other kinds of texts. We are also looking
for a test case that includes recognized exemplar
changes so we may gain more insight in lexical
consequences in subsequent copies of a text. With
the results of these and of other experiments, we will
return to Walewein and then also have a look at the
two short fragments which survive from another
manuscript (cf. Section 2). Because of the smallness
of these fragments we did not include them in our
measurements up till now.
On a methodological and technical level, we want
to advance the application we have developed to
compute Delta graphs for a single text. It would be
very valuable if we were able to compute which
subset of the vocabulary creates the most significant
‘Delta contrast’ between two parts of a text (in this
case, between the parts supposedly written by
different authors), as we think that this may shed
more light on how the work of one author differs
from that of another. However, although the
current application is able to compute a Delta
graph for a given text, it is not able to evaluate the
general characteristics of such a graph, nor to
statistically validate those general characteristics. In
addition, the current application cannot easily and
automatically generate and compare a large collec-
tion of Delta graphs based on an iterative subselec-
tion of a word frequency list. Both these capabilities
are needed if we want to calculate more conclusively
the most significant Delta contrast in a text.
Furthering our method and technology in this
direction poses an interesting challenge, as quite
sophisticated statistical approaches will be needed,
as well as some amount of grid computing given the
large number of graphs and validations that would
have to be computed.
It seems plausible that the application of
Burrows’s Delta to these sorts of questions can be
used not only for texts in Middle Dutch, but also for
younger Dutch texts and for texts in other
languages. We hope that colleagues working in
these areas will be interested in collaborating in this;
that is, that they will be interested in testing the
methods on other time periods and languages and,
together with the present authors, in refining it for
more general use.
A very important aspect of our work is the tools
we have developed. We should like to provide the
international research community with these tools,
as they will be useful not only for the research of
colleagues but also for the repeatability of our own
work. This, after all, is a very important aspect
of good research.

Notes
1 This article is based on, and builds upon, the papers the
authors read at the ALLC/ACH joint conferences in
2005 (van Dalen-Oskam and van Zundert, Mining the
Differences between Penninc and Vostaert) and 2004 (van
Dalen-Oskam, Penninc versus Vostaert: Contrasting
co-authors by Means of Authorship Attribution
Techniques), at the XXI International Arthurian
Conference in 2005 (van Dalen-Oskam and van
Zundert, The Voice of the Sword or the Voice of the
Court?) and at the eleventh International Medieval
Congress in Leeds in 2004 (van Dalen-Oskam,
Contrasting Themes in Penninc and Vostaert’s Roman
van Walewein).
2 Van Es adapted the use of u/v and i/j to modern Dutch
usage and modernized interpunction and capital
initials. The minor editorial changes in the text he
opted for are listed and accounted for in the edition.
The type of edition did not interfere with the results of
our measurement because of our choice to lemmatize
the text, cf. Section 3.
3 Cf. Prologue, lines 23–27 (in the translation of
Johnson and Claassens, who present their English
translation on the opposite pages of their edition of
the Middle Dutch text): ‘Thus prayed Penninc, who
made this book. And many a night he sat sleepless
over it before he considered in his mind that he had
completed the book upon which he had started’
(Johnson and Claassens, 2000, p. 29).
4 Cf. Epilogue, lines 11,173–11,188: ‘Penninc,
who composed this book – I do not care who hears
it – was unwise not to have brought it to an end.
Pieter Vostaert continued it as best he could
according to the text that he found which Penninc
left behind: it seemed to him a pity for it to be
left unfinished, but seeing as how it lacked a
conclusion, I believe little credit would have been
accorded the poet; what is more without an ending
all of his pains and effort would not have been worth
a cherry. Approximately thirty-three hundred
verses were composed by Pieter as skilfully as he
could, in simple rhyme.’ (Johnson and Claassens,
2000, p. 495)
5 Van Es, 1957, 2: pp. 342–3. Only implicitly mentioned
in Sonnemans, 1995, 1: pp. 110–2.
6 The two other options would be that Vostaert
included the prologue but not the epilogue in his
3,300 and that he included the epilogue but not the
prologue, but these options do not extend the area
as aforementioned.
7 We reported on our first experiments in van Dalen-
Oskam and van Zundert, 2005.
8 Another benefit of using lemmatized texts is that the
results of any measurements can easily be checked
against the raw text. If only the raw texts are tested,
however, any further checking requires additional
normalization and analysis.
9 Cf. van Dalen-Oskam and van Zundert, 2004.
10 Cf. Yule, 1944. This specific form of the formula
of K is taken from Tweedie and Baayen, 1998,
p. 330 (16).
11 We are aware of the fact that we are comparing parts
of the same texts. Because we are fairly certain that this
text is written by two authors, we think it is valid to
make these comparisons. In theory, it is possible that
the graph reaches the horizontal axis at a point where
this text part is compared with itself. To check
whether this could be the case, we plan to experiment
with e.g. removing sections from the complete text in
a next phase of our research.
12 We measured Delta for the dialogue and non-dialogue
text in Walewein with a sliding window, but this did
not result in graphs that were in any way insightful or
significant with regard to differences in the use of
high-frequency words by either Penninc or Vostaert in
dialogue or non-dialogue.

13 How exactly this process came about will have to be
the subject of further analysis, study, and debate.
It could be that Vostaert initially tried to model his
style of writing on what his predecessor had written.
But as he progressed, he may have given up on
the idea of imitating, and fell back on his own style
of writing. Alternatively, Vostaert might have deliber-
ately or rather intuitively tried to create a smooth
transition from the already existing text into his own
work, by adapting the latter part of Penninc’s text. For
now any such qualitative interpretations of this
intriguing part remain speculative.
