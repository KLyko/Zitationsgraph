The Weekly Magazine, or Gentleman and Lady’s
Polite Companion was launched on 29 December
1759; it ran for a mere six numbers. Goldsmith’s
connection with the journal lay unrecognised until
1935, when Arthur Friedman revealed that two
pieces included in Goldsmith’s Essays of 1765 had
first appeared in its pages. The four numbers which
Friedman examined in the Huntington Library—at
that time the only extant copy—contained other
material which, he argued, could be attributed to
Goldsmith, in two cases with ‘a very high degree of
probability’ (Friedman, 1935, p. 382). When he
published his magisterial edition of the Collected
Works, Friedman included seven of these essays
(though with some hesitations) and acknowledged
the possibility that four other essays might be from
Goldsmith’s hand (Friedman, 1966, iii, pp. 22–56—
we refer to this edition as Works). Then in 1986,
with the happy discovery of another file of the
magazine, containing two further numbers, Roger
Lonsdale demonstrated that a third item in Essays
by Mr. Goldsmith had first appeared in the Weekly,
and suggested the likelihood that Goldsmith was
responsible, as author or translator, for four pieces
in the fifth and sixth numbers (Lonsdale, 1986).1
No other items call for our consideration, apart
from one short piece in the final number, to which
we shall return.
We have, then, fifteen possible attributions,
which we label ‘doubtfuls’. We list them in order
of publication, with a resume for those essays not
included in Works. In quoting from the Weekly we
have silently emended obvious typographical errors
and occasionally modified the punctuation.
d1 Introduction (pp. i–4). In fact a double
introduction. The magazine’s editors, a ‘Society of
Gentlemen’, have declined various offers of assis-
tance, including some from yet another ‘set of
gentlemen’ whose rejected introduction they pro-
ceed to print. It satirises the hypocrisy of editors
who profess every motive for publication except the
true one – lining their own pockets (Golden, 1956,

We shall need to consider the affinities between
two of these doubtfuls and two other essays.
The Weekly’s discussion of music (d12) has links
with the slightly later ‘On the different Schools
of Music’ in the British Magazine (Works, iii,
pp. 91–3); ‘Thoughts on Peace’ (d4) has very
close verbal parallels with the final section of
‘On Public Rejoicings for Victory’, published
two months earlier in the Busy Body (Works, iii,
pp. 16–21). Both these ancillary items, being
anonymous, are also ‘doubtful’; we label them d17
and d18, respectively.
Each of the Weekly’s doubtful essays has some
claim to canonical status. Stylometric testing of
what we label ‘linguistic features’—aspects of vocab-
ulary, grammar and syntax—and of sentence-length
may help to bolster (or may perhaps weaken) those
claims.
2 Linguistic Features
Our characterisation of Goldsmith’s writing habits
is based, as in our previous studies, on those essays
which appeared anonymously between October
1759 and September 1761, and which reappeared
in Essays by Mr. Goldsmith (1765, with a second
edition in the following year). We have added
‘A City Night-Piece’, first published in the Bee and
authenticated by its inclusion in The Citizen of the
World. This body of text, consisting of 38,112
words, we refer to as the ‘corpus’. To avoid
distorting our results we next discarded material

closely translated from French sources, together
with the parodic ‘Specimen of a Magazine’
(Works, iii, pp. 191–5), and the rules of the
‘philosophical club’ (Works, iii, pp. 15–16).
We have used the original, unrevised texts of these
genuine essays, in order to compare like with
like, since most of the doubtfuls did not have the
benefit of revision. We have modernised spelling
(‘any thing’, for example, becomes a single word),
and repunctuated, deeming a sentence to be any
grammatically self-sufficient unit. We prevent
sentences from beginning with ‘and’ or ‘for’,
but oblige them, grammar permitting, to begin
with ‘but’ or ‘yet’.
The text was then divided into forty consecutive
samples each of 750 words. A large battery of
tests was directed at the samples, to identify
linguistics features which might distinguish
Goldsmith’s style. Some tests measured easily
discernible aspects of his writings: a fondness
for generally, for I was resolved, and for word-
patterns. Others—use of triplets, collocations such
as ‘of followed by the’—drew on the work of
pioneers in the attribution field, including Louis T.
Milic (1967) and A. Q. Morton (1978). Others still
were prompted by conjecture: perhaps the number
of occurrences of verbs, adjectives, that-clauses, etc.
might prove significant.
We need to be sure that the features we examine
are particular to Goldsmith, that they are his
linguistic preferences and not simply habits shared
by contemporary essayists. We have selected for
comparison samples of work published between
1753 and 1764: from Hugh Kelly’s Babler
(seven samples) and Arthur Murphy’s Gray’s Inn
Journal (six), with five samples from essays by
each of the following: Johnson, Joseph Warton,
Edward Moore, the Earl of Chesterfield, Richard
Owen Cambridge, Horace Walpole, and the Earl of
Cork, together with five samples from the
Connoisseur, the joint production of Bonnell
Thornton and George Colman. Kelly and Murphy
were compatriots of Goldsmith, with similar
backgrounds and interests; we give them fuller
representation, since we earlier encountered
some difficulty in telling these three writers
apart (Dixon and Mannion, 1993, p. 17).
The control essays are listed in Appendix B.
The same principles of modernising and
repunctuating have been applied to both the
controls and the doubtfuls.
Inspection of the data led to the immediate
discarding of many tests, where for example
the Goldsmith scores were too wide in range,
encompassing the scores for all the controls.
Thirty-five different linguistic features survived,
to be subjected to statistical analysis; they are
listed in Appendix A. Some tests are concerned
with sentence-structure, for example the occurrence
of a verb as the penultimate word. Since all
the scores for this type of test are expressed
as percentages, the small variations in the
number of sentences per sample do not affect the
results.
Several doubtful essays are long enough to
yield two or more 750-word samples. We have in
all twenty-five samples, sr, numbered as follows:
s1; s2 ðd1Þ; s3; s4; s5 ðd2Þ; s6; s7 ðd4Þ; s8; s9; s10 ðd5Þ;
s11; s12 ðd6Þ; s13; s14 ðd7Þ; s15 ðd8Þ; s16 ðd9Þ;
s17 ðd10Þ; s18 ðd11Þ; s19 ðd12Þ; s20 ðd13Þ; s21 ðd15Þ;
s22 ðd16Þ; s23 ðd17Þ; s24; s25 ðd18Þ:
The essay on painters (d14) is not susceptible to
linguistic tests, since, as Lonsdale has pointed out,
it is ‘literally translated’ from part of the article
‘Ecole’ in the Encyclopedie (Lonsdale, 1986, p. 221).
The assumption throughout is that every
word in a sample has come from the pen of its
author. We know, however, that eighteenth-century
editors and compositors exercised their absolute
right to ‘improve’ submitted articles. The editor
of the ‘Occasional Prompter’ series in the
Daily Journal certainly did so (Lockwood, 1980,
p. 51), and both editor and printer modified at
least one of Fielding’s contributions to
Common Sense (Battestin and Battestin 1980,
pp. 131–43). Smollett was prepared to tinker
with essays published in his British Magazine
(to which Goldsmith contributed) in order,
as he put it, ‘to fit them for the public’ (Basker,
1988, pp. 190–91).2 The extent to which our
texts were tampered with is an unknown quantity.
We can only acknowledge that an assumption of
absolute textual integrity is unwarranted.

3 Statistical Analysis
We describe a decision-making procedure based
on the statistics derived from observation of
elements of style embedded in samples of text,
with the aim primarily of identifying those
samples that seem unlikely to have been written
by an author who has previously been proposed.
We assume that an author will have preferences,
more or less conscious, with regard to the use of
certain linguistic features. For example, one author
makes frequent use of emphatic words such as
even, ever, every, another makes modest use of
such words, while a third prefers not to use them at
all. The frequency of use of such features constitutes
a basis of comparison between authors. When there
is uncertainty as to the identity of the author, these
frequencies can help to reduce the uncertainty.
Of all the possible linguistic features that an
author might employ, perhaps only a small subset
have discriminatory value, helping to distinguish one
author from another. We need to establish which
these features are, and to use only these in the
analysis.
To provide a general framework for our discus-
sion, we suppose that we have samples of text from
the work of m authors that are available for the
purpose of feature selection. Let these be:
A1; . . . ;Ai; . . . ;Am. Let ni be the number of samples
of text taken from the work of author Ai, and let T il
denote the l-th sample of text of author
i; l ¼ 1; . . . ; ni; i ¼ 1; . . . ;m: Let there be p linguis-
tic features, f1; . . . ; fj; . . . ; fp, which might have
discriminatory potential and whose frequency has
been observed. Let xilj be the frequency of fj in T il .
These frequencies are assembled in a data matrix—
see Table 1, 2, and 3 in Appendix C. The data matrix
for author Ai is:
xi11 . . . xi1j . . . xi1p

SSðjÞW is the within groups (authors) sum of squares,
and SSðjÞB is the between groups sum of squares.
MSðjÞW is the within groups mean square, and MS
ðjÞ
B is
the between groups mean square. Fj is the ratio of
the mean squares (the variance ratio):
Fj ¼
MSðjÞB
MSðjÞW
:
Fj is Fisher’s F-statistic in the context of one-way
analysis of variance. A relatively small value of Fj
entails within group means xij not very different
between themselves, indicating authors not very
different between themselves. A relatively large value
of Fj indicates differences between the authors. Since
we know that the authors are different, a small value
of Fj suggests that feature fj is not effective in
detecting differences between authors—a large value
indicates that it is effective. Thus we can use Fj as a
measure of the sensitivity of fj in detecting diffe-
rences between authors. For a collection of features,
those for which Fj is large will be the better
discriminators. To decide what is large and what is
small we need to invoke the standard set of assump-
tions as follows. For a given feature fj, we suppose
that the xilj are independent and xilj  N ði; 2Þ;
l ¼ 1; . . . ; ni; i ¼ 1; . . . ;m, where N ð; 2Þ denotes
the normal distribution with mean  and variance
2, and where x  D is shorthand for: x is a value
drawn from the probability distribution D. A large
F-value is evidence against the hypothesis H0: 1 ¼
2 ¼ . . . ¼ m. Let Fðm  1; n  mÞ denote
Fisher’s F-distribution on ðm  1; n  mÞ degrees
of freedom. Let P; 0 < P < 1; be small (say less than
0.1). If X  Fðm  1; n  mÞ and c is such that
Pr½X > c ¼ P, then an F-value greater than c is
evidence against H0. Accordingly, we exclude from

So we consider the samples s4 ðd2Þ; s6; s7 ðd4Þ;
s19 ðd12Þ; s20 ðd13Þ; s23 ðd17Þ not to be from the
hand of Goldsmith.
The above assessment of the discriminatory
effectiveness of a feature fj has been calculated
without regard to its possible interaction with
other features. In view of the multivariate character
of the data, however, a better approach would
be, for a given value of q, q ¼ 1; . . . ; 35, to identify
those q features which collectively have the best
discriminatory value. This allows the inclusion of
a feature which in isolation has a low F-value,
but when used in conjunction with other
features has good discriminatory value. Thus,
we should measure the discriminatory value of a
subset of q features, ffj1 ; . . . ; fjqg and choose the
subset, Bq ¼ ffj1 ; . . . ; fjq g; which has the best
discriminatory value. In this regard, a useful
reference for discriminant analysis and variable
selection is Krzanowski and Marriott, 1995. Let
yil ¼ ðxilj1; . . . ; xiljp Þ
0, where fj1; . . . ; jqg; 1  j1 
. . .  jq  p, is a subset of f1; . . . ; pg. Let
j ¼ ðj1; . . . ; jqÞ0. BqðjÞ and W qðjÞ are the between-
group and within-group mean square q  q
symmetric matrices, respectively:

For a given fixed q, we choose the q features that
maximize the between-group/within-group mean
squares ratio. Thus
ffj1 ; . . . ; fjq g;
is the set of q features where jq ¼ ðj1 ; . . . ; jq Þ
0 is the
value of j that maximizes
jBqðjÞj
jW qðjÞj
;
where jMj denotes the determinant of matrix M.
We score the features according to the number

otherwise. The score for fj is Nj ¼

f13  f15  f28  f30  f1  f5  f20  f4  f31 
f3  f12  f24  f14  f34  f19  f7  f32  f22 
f33  f35  f8  f17  f16  f27  f29  f10:
Thus, for example, f2 and f21, both with scores of
34, are the two most discriminatory features, and f10
is the least discriminatory, with a score of 1. The
rank correlation, 0.6532, between this ranking and
the ranking obtained where the features are assessed
independently of each other is, reassuringly, quite
large.
The distances of the doubtfuls from the centre
of the Goldsmith cluster depend on q. We
measure the P-value for each doubtful for
each value of q, and count the number of times
the P-value is less than 0.1. We view a doubtful
sample as unlikely to have been written by
Goldsmith if the count is large. Thus, referring to
Table 5, Appendix C, we regard each of the
following as unlikely Goldsmith candidates:
s6 ðd4Þ; s7 ðd4Þ; s19 ðd12Þ; s20 ðd13Þ: We also regard
s9 ðd5Þ; s14 ðd7Þ; s23 ðd17Þ as having weak claims to
be by Goldsmith.
4 Sentence-length
In a previous study we concluded that in terms
of sentence-length Goldsmith’s essays were remark-
ably consistent. Furthermore, measures of sentence-
length derived from sixteen of his genuine essays
set Goldsmith well apart from his contemporaries
(represented by a total of fifty essays, listed
in Appendix B), with the exception of three
of Johnson’s Idlers (Mannion and Dixon, 2004).
On this basis we can proceed to a direct comparison
of the Goldsmith scores, as established in that
study, with those of the doubtfuls. Previously
we used both correspondence analysis and the

2 goodness-of-fit test. Here we use only the
latter—it allows a precise measure of significance.
‘Modern Painting’ (d14) is a special case: eighty-one
of its 103 sentences correspond exactly to those of
its source, but the translator has sometimes split
a long French sentence into two, has in one
place combined two of the original sentences,
and in another has made a substantial addition to
the text. We thus have twenty-two sentences—a
modest total, yielding modest evidence—whose
lengths have been determined by the translator,
and to which we can apply our test (different
from our previous study, here we employ only the
2 measure).
We group the sentences of a particular essay,
E, according to their lengths. The first group,
(0,9], contains those sentences of lengths less
than ten. The second group, (9,13], contains those
sentences of lengths more than nine and less
than fourteen. And so on, the remaining groups
being (13,17], (17,20], (20,24], (24,29], (29,36],
(36,1)—making a total of eight groups. Let mk
be the number of sentences in E in the k-th
group, k ¼ 1; . . . ; 8. We compare the sentence-
length profile of each doubtful essay with that of
the sixteen Goldsmith essays combined into a
single text G.
In the case E ¼ G, we find m1 ¼ 162; m2 ¼ 158;
m3 ¼ 174; m4 ¼ 153; m5 ¼ 153; m6 ¼ 177; m7 ¼
152; m8 ¼ 164. The boundary values for the
groups—9, 13, 17, 20, 24, 29, 36—were chosen so
that N ¼ 1293 sentences of G are shared in
approximately equal numbers among the eight
groups. fk ¼ mkN is the proportion of sentences in
the k-th group: f1 ¼ 0:125; f2 ¼ 0:122; f3 ¼ 0:135;
f4 ¼ 0:118; f5 ¼ 0:118; f6 ¼ 0:137; f7 ¼ 0:118; f8 ¼
0:127 (3 d.p.). We then compute the 2 goodness-
of-fit measure for E:
2ðEÞ ¼
X8
k¼1
ðmk  mfkÞ2
mfk
;
where m ¼ m1 þ . . . þ m8 is the total number of
sentences in E. The P-value for E is
PðEÞ ¼ Pr½Z > 2ðEÞ, where Z is a 2 random
variable on seven degrees of freedom. A small value
of PðEÞ (less than 0.05, say) suggests that Goldsmith
was unlikely to have been the author of E. We find:
Pðd1Þ ¼ 0:272; Pðd2Þ ¼ 0:002; Pðd4Þ ¼ 0:764;
Pðd5Þ ¼ 0:046; Pðd6Þ ¼ 0:106; Pðd7Þ ¼ 0:229;
Pðd8Þ ¼ 0:017; Pðd9Þ ¼ 0:371; Pðd10Þ ¼ 0:365;
Pðd11Þ ¼ 0:610; Pðd12Þ ¼ 0:086; Pðd13Þ ¼ 0:000;
Pðd14Þ ¼ 0:077; Pðd15Þ ¼ 0:910; Pðd16Þ ¼ 0:438;
Pðd17Þ ¼ 0:476; Pðd18Þ ¼ 0:280:
So d2; d5; d8; d13 are unlikely to have been written
by Goldsmith. We might add to these d12 and d14,
both with relatively small P-values.
5 Assessing the Evidence
We have identified seven samples from the Weekly
as unlikely to have come from Goldsmith’s hand, on
the evidence of their scores for linguistic features,
and six essays as suspect on grounds of sentence-
length (two less so than the others). We believe that
these adverse results deserve to carry weight;
whoever is responsible for these texts is not writing
in Goldsmith’s manner, as represented by his
acknowledged essays. For the remaining material,
we prefer to say that it has produced ‘favourable’
rather than ‘positive’ scores. Nothing in the
stylistic profile of these samples militates against
Goldsmith’s authorship. But there always remains
the possibility that the writing could be the work
of some unidentified author who happened to
have similar linguistic habits. We are therefore
never entitled to go further than ‘It is very probable
that this piece could have been written by
Goldsmith.’
In any case, stylometric results provide only
one kind of evidence. We need to consider every-
thing that bears on the question of attribution,
including:
5.1 Parallels of thought and expression
‘All [Goldsmith’s] productions are in some degree
echoes of each other’: Leigh Hunt’s judgement may
be thought a little harsh (Rousseau, 1974, p. 316).
But Goldsmith’s habit of borrowing from himself
is something the attributionist has reason to be
grateful for. Almost all the many parallels between

Goldsmith and the doubtfuls which are cited by
Crane (1927), Friedman (1935), and Golden (1956)
satisfy the criterion laid down by E.H.C.Oliphant:
‘The only true parallel is one that duplicates both
thought and the expression of the thought’
(Oliphant, 1929, p. 1). We are able to add a few
further parallels, which we trust also satisfy that
criterion, and heed Oliphant’s additional cautions:
it is ‘useless’ to quote ‘phrases common to the
speech of the time or thoughts that were common
property’; parallels may be the result of the
‘unconscious repetition’ of another author, or
of ‘haphazard coincidence’, or of plain theft
(Oliphant, 1929, p. 14). The matter of theft is
especially relevant. Goldsmith was never scrupulous
about annexing other people’s words, so that a
parallel between a doubtful and a later Goldsmith
text may be a matter of plagiarism rather than self-
plagiarism. As a contributor to the Weekly he may
be presumed to have looked through items
other than his own. It follows that a parallel from
a review in the Monthly or Critical, from Polite
Learning or the Bee, all of which antedate the
Weekly, must be accorded greater weight than
one from The Citizen of the World.
5.2 Visible markers of style
Stylometric testing has very justly been compared to
the use of aerial photography, enabling ‘patterns
to be detected which are obscured when one is
too close to the ground’ (Kenny, 1986, p. 116). But
even at ground level an irregularity in the surface of
a doubtful text is occasionally noticeable, some
unusual stylistic feature, perhaps a preference for a
certain syntactical structure, which distinguishes
its author from Goldsmith (Such a feature does
not appear among the thirty-five tests, since
those were used to discriminate Goldsmith from
the controls, without any reference, at that stage,
to the doubtfuls). Or a doubtful text may exhibit
fondness for a word or phrase which Goldsmith
uses sparingly, or for which he has a preferred
alternative. A word employed in a sense which is
foreign to the corpus may also deserve
consideration.
On one occasion Goldsmith himself used
the ‘argument from quality’, specifically to trounce
those who attributed to Edward Young an
impromptu epigram on Voltaire, but also to offer
a caution to attributionists: ‘I only mention this to
shew what trifles are generally ascribed to men
when once grown famous. The wretchedness of the
epigram will readily convince those who have any
pretensions to taste, that Dr. Young could never
have been the author: probably some blockhead
made the verses first, and the story after’ (Works, iii,
p. 253). Nevertheless this kind of negative argument
is of little help in the present investigation, since we
are considering pieces which, in at least some cases,
may have been rushed into print. We side, therefore,
rather with Johnson than Goldsmith: to those who
questioned the authenticity of the three parts
of Shakespeare’s Henry VI Johnson replied: ‘From
mere inferiority nothing can be inferred; in the
productions of wit there will be inequality.
Sometimes judgment will err, and sometimes
the matter itself will defeat the artist’ (Johnson,
1968, p. 611).
Finally, some evidence is perversely capable of
facing both ways. Three essays from the Weekly were
reprinted in the Lady’s Magazine, between
December 1760 and October 1761, when it is
generally agreed that Goldsmith was that magazine’s
editor (Crane, 1927, p. xxxii). The first to appear
was the authentic ‘Some Remarks on the modern
Manner of Preaching’, later included in the 1765
Essays. It was followed by ‘The History of Regnard’
(d6), and ‘Thoughts on Peace’ (d4). Does the
reprinting afford a presumption of authorship?
Or was Goldsmith following the established
custom of appropriating material, without acknowl-
edgement, from an earlier periodical, as he had done
in the later numbers of the Bee? That the ‘Thoughts
on Peace’ are updated (the political situation
having changed) and furnished with an introduc-
tory paragraph may represent an author remodel-
ling his own handiwork. Or it may be a case of
resetting a stolen jewel.
6 Bringing the Evidence to Bear
It is impracticable to quote here all the relevant
parallels; we shall simply refer to the articles and

editions in which they can be found. Since Friedman
did not include in Works all the parallels which
he had identified in his 1935 article, we normally
cite the latter, and cite it as ‘Friedman’ tout court.
Likewise ‘Golden’ stands for his 1956 contribution
to Notes and Queries.
6.1 ‘Introduction’ (d1)
There is considerable evidence in favour of
Goldsmith’s authorship:
(i) We can add a further parallel to those noted by
Friedman and Golden: ‘we have weighed fame
in the balance . . .; an alderman, with forty
thousand pounds in his pocket has some reason
to laugh; a wit, without sixpence . . . should go
weep; turtle against Tully, ye exhilerating
powers, for all the world to nothing’ (p. iii;
an alderman’s delight in a turtle-feast was
something of a clich e, as at Works, iii,
p. 102.17,173.11). A sentence in The Citizen of
the World uses the same antithesis: a poor
author ‘finds, that having fed upon turtle is a
more ready way to fame than having digested
Tully’ (Works, ii, p. 238).
(ii) The list of the Weekly’s staff writers includes
‘dirty-shirted authors’; persons who wear dirty
shirts are not uncommon in Goldsmith
(e.g. Works, i, p. 362; ii, pp. 125, 218, 228;
iii, p. 295).
(iii) The later ‘Specimen of a Magazine’ (Works, iii,
pp. 191–5) also has the unusual word ‘maga-
ziner’ (a writer of magazine articles). Its
contents, too, are gaily miscellaneous, and it
too purports to have been written by a ‘Society
of Gentlemen’, thus poking mild fun, as the
Weekly is doing, at more august journals—the
Critical Review and the Royal Magazine, for
example—which brandish the phrase on their
title-pages (Works, iii, p. 188.16).
In terms of linguistic features and sentence-
length this item has the attributes of a Goldsmith
essay.
It could well be that Goldsmith was the principal
if not the sole author of this high-spirited piece,
with perhaps some input from other members of
the ‘Society of Gentlemen’.
6.2 ‘A Description of the Manners and
Customs of the Native Irish’ (d2)
Morris Golden argued that the paragraphs which
introduce the ‘Letter from an English Gentleman’
and the concluding paragraph of the letter
itself ‘show distinct traces of Goldsmith’s manner’,
while the remainder is ‘undistinguished and
matter-of-fact’. We first divided the piece in two,
with ‘d3’ accommodating all Golden’s inauthentic
material. But it was clearly preferable to assess
his argument once we had looked at the essay as
a whole—hence the disappearance of d3.
It is true that the few verbal parallels are found at
the beginning and end of the essay. In addition
to the two given by Friedman we may compare:
‘here [at one of their festivals] they may be literally
said to dance for their bread’ (p. 12; Works, iii,
p. 29) with the statement that Caravaggio ‘was
driven from city to city in the utmost indigence,
and might truly be said to paint for his bread’
(Bee, Works, i, pp. 453–4).
The measures of sentence-length place this
piece well outside the Goldsmith essays, while the
middle section (s4) is unlike Goldsmith in its
linguistic features. Golden’s argument seems there-
fore very plausible: Goldsmith was using the same
‘framing’ technique that he had employed in the Bee
(e.g. Works, i, pp. 370–72 and 483–6), adding
introductory and concluding matter to someone
else’s work, whether already published, as in the
Bee, or newly submitted for publication, which
may be the case here. Goldsmith was perhaps
responsible for all the introductory paragraphs.
The remaining points at which his hand is
discernible—the last sentence of the antepenulti-
mate paragraph, and the final sentence—are pre-
cisely those places where someone preparing an
MS contribution for the press might intervene to
‘improve’ the text.
6.3 ‘Some thoughts preliminary
to a general peace’ (d4)
The author sounds three cautionary notes: a victor-
ious nation must not insist on an excessively harsh
peace settlement; it must beware of over-extending
its dominions; its military successes may conceal,
and even increase, its domestic wretchedness.

The second warning, against ill-considered coloni-
sation, was to be elaborated in letters 17 and 25 of
The Citizen of the World, and was also propounded
in Goldsmith’s unpublished fragment ‘The Political
View of the Present War’, which probably dates
from 1760–1 (Crane, 1927, p. 91). There are,
however, no parallels with earlier genuine material.
But the relationship between d4 and an earlier
doubtful text, ‘Public Rejoicings for Victory’ (our
d18) is undeniable. That essay had appeared two
months previously in the Busy Body. Its two final
paragraphs rehearse the first and third of the
warnings sounded in ‘Thoughts on Peace’, and
there are striking verbal parallels (Crane 1927,
pp. 91,93,94; Friedman). The links are sufficient
to suggest that the same hand was at work, and
the parallels between both essays and later
Goldsmith (d18 has connections with letters 4 and
17 of The Citizen of the World) would seem
to confirm that hand as Goldsmith’s. For Crane
and Friedman this evidence was decisive (Crane,
1927, p. 89; Works, iii, p. 4, 30).
We note some small counter-indications:
(i) ‘Thoughts on Peace’ begins with the phrase
‘The empire of England’. Goldsmith prefers
‘the British empire’ (Works, iii, p. 175.5; History
of England, 1764, ii, p. 234).
(ii) ‘our natural country’ (Works, iii, p. 33.1); none
of the twelve occurrences of natural in the
corpus has the meaning of ‘native’ (OED last
records the phrase ‘natural country’ in 1585).
(iii) More hesitantly we adduce a heavy-handedness
that seems untypical of Goldsmith even at
his most serious: ‘The conjuncture is decisive
in [England’s] favour . . . ’; ‘Indemnification
for what is past, and security for the future,
are the essential objects in a treaty of pacifica-
tion, but both these may be easily effected
without any accession to our present
dominions.’
Given the web of parallels we expected that,
despite these anomalies, our results for both
doubtfuls would be similar and very favourable.
The linguistic features scores for ‘Public Rejoicings’
are certainly favourable. In contrast, both
samples from ‘Thoughts on Peace’ have
emphatically adverse scores. Though the essay
therefore looks distinctly unlike Goldsmith, we do
not propose that these scores should automatically
trump the evidence from the verbal parallels. As
M.W.A. Smith has said, ‘a strongly held scholarly
consensus should take precedence over an unex-
pected stylometric result until the conflict can be
resolved’ (Smith, 1992, p. 436, n. l4); the judgement
is made the more telling by Smith’s record as
practitioner and champion of rigorous stylometric
investigation. To help resolve the conflict we suggest
that in writing ‘Thoughts on Peace’ as a weighty
sequel to the more light-hearted ‘Public Rejoicings’
Goldsmith drew for some of his political arguments
on ideas and phraseology which he had picked
up from contemporary pamphlets or from coffee-
house conversation (It is just conceivable that
another member of the ‘Society of Gentlemen’ lent
a hand).
6.4 ‘Memoirs of berkeley’ (d5)
The sole reason for attributing this piece to
Goldsmith is that it reports the dangerous experi-
ment in which Berkeley was assisted by his
‘companion (whose name was Contarine, and
from whom I had the story)’. This Contarine was
Goldsmith’s uncle, a relationship which according
to Friedman makes it ‘very probable’ that
Goldsmith ‘was the author of the anecdote and
the memoirs’ (Works, iii, p. 35, and note). Who
but Goldsmith, Friedman asks, would have had
access to the source? Morris Golden thought
that Friedman had proceeded too hastily from the
part to the whole: Goldsmith could have commu-
nicated the story to whoever was preparing the
‘Memoirs’ for publication, or could have inserted
it in the submitted manuscript.
The second sample from this piece (s9) has a
score for linguistic features in the ‘unlikely’
category. Its sentence-length results set the whole
essay at a distance from Goldsmith, and further
evidence is provided by two visible markers:
(i) In the corpus the ratio of occurrences of
the verbal phrase to regard as to the virtually
synonymous look upon /on as is 8:3; in d5
it is 1:4.

(ii) The author of d5 has a predilection for the
syntactic process known as ‘fronting’, in which
the direct object or prepositional complement
of the verb precedes its subject. Thus:
The country, which was desolate and
unimproved, he took the utmost pains
to improve . . .
. . . the dispensation of charity he
looked upon as his duty.
music he was particularly fond of . . . .
His income he was entirely con-
tented with . . . (pp. 34, 37; Works, iii,
pp. 37, 40)
There are in all nine occurrences, an average of
four in 750 words. Twelve of our forty Goldsmith
750-word samples contain a single instance of
such inversion; in just one sample it occurs twice.
More important, for Goldsmith this structure
always carries a deictic or exclamatory charge:
‘this she might have enjoyed’; ‘Ingratitude, con-
tempt, and hatred, I can now suffer’ (Works, iii,
p. 111, 65). This is the case in only three of
d5’s examples.
Friedman cites no parallels with genuine
Goldsmith. But the statement that ‘They
[Berkeley’s ‘Queries’] were read, approved for
the most part, and forgotten’ (p. 36; Works, iii,
p. 39) echoes earlier summaries of literary fortunes:
‘the poet . . . is praised by all, read by a few, and soon
forgotten’ (Polite Learning, Works, i, p. 317; cf. i,
p. 110); and ‘we have seen him read by a few,
praised by all, and soon forgotten’ (Bee, Works,
i, p. 411). We suspect that, having added the
Contarine anecdote to the memoir, Goldsmith was
tempted to a little more tinkering, and chose to
make further use of his pithy formulation. Perhaps
the dry comment that a fellowship at Trinity College
is ‘the only reward of learning that kingdom has
to bestow’ (p. l8; Works, iii, p. 35) is yet another
interpolation; in a letter of 1757 Goldsmith
had lamented the paucity in Ireland of ‘rewards to
learned men’ (Balderston, 1928, p. 29).
In short, like Golden, we consider this essay
as similar to ‘Manners of the Irish’, in that
Goldsmith has simply added here and there to
another’s text.
6.5 ‘The history of regnard’ (d6)
Regnard’s life-story would have appealed to
Goldsmith, with his keen eye for hardship and
misery, and himself a gambler, traveller, and exile.
There is, however, only one verbal parallel, pointed
out by Crane (Crane, 1927, p. 133): the phrase
‘philosophic vagabond’, which Goldsmith had
already used in the Bee (Works, i, p. 370), and
which he reused in The Vicar of Wakefield (Works,
iv, p. 106). Both samples from this mini-biography
have favourable scores for linguistic features and
sentence-length. The heavy reliance on the adverb
now to maintain narrative momentum (eleven
occurrences in 1500 words), and the repetition of
a word or phrase within a very short space
(examples include at once, considerable, and
attend) are perhaps signs of haste. We suggest that
Goldsmith was responsible for this ‘History’, but
admit that he was in part merely condensing
information from the prefatory biography in the
1758 edition of Regnard’s OEuvres (of which his
library held a copy at the time of his death: Amory,
1973, p. 244), together with material from another,
untraced, source.
6.6 ‘The Life of the Hon. Robert Boyle’
(d7)
The first paragraph has close affinities with the
beginning of the ‘Memoirs of Voltaire’, and with a
letter of 1758 (Friedman). The commendation of
the Irish practice of plunging an infant ‘every day
in cold water’, which ‘fits perhaps the mind not
less than the body for vigor and dispatch’ (p. 40;
Works, iii, p. 41) echoes a statement in ‘Of
Education’: siting schools ‘a little out of town
. . . would certainly conduce to the health and vigour
of, perhaps, the mind, as well as the body’
(Bee, Works, i, p. 456). Goldsmith’s authorship is
plausible in terms of sentence-length, but rather less
so for linguistic features; the second sample (s14)
falls into the ‘unlikely’ class. We know that about
half of the essay is borrowed from Biographia
Britannica. Goldsmith may have blended
that material with another source, his own con-
tribution being limited once again to the opening
paragraph and some incidental touches.

6.7 ‘Improvements and Discoveries
that might attend a more extensive
Knowledge of remote Countries’ (d8)
Of Goldsmith’s strong interest in such ‘improve-
ments’ there is no doubt. In 1756 or 1757 he
spoke enthusiastically of going himself to decipher
the inscriptions on the so-called ‘written mountains’
of Sinai (Percy, 1801, pp. 39–40). But thereafter
his advocacy of travel to the Orient has a more
practical emphasis. Six months before the appear-
ance of this essay a reviewer in the Critical—
probably, but not certainly Goldsmith—denigrates
the collecting of ‘mutilated inscriptions’; better
to return home with a knowledge of dyestuffs
(Works, i, pp. 183–5; on Goldsmith’s authorship
see Friedman, 1946, p. 35). Similarly Letter 108 of
The Citizen of the World scoffs at travellers who
merely transcribe inscriptions, and stresses
the ‘useful knowledge’ and ‘useful inventions’
which they should bring home instead (Works, ii,
pp. 419–20). The first third of d8, on the other
hand, encourages the investigation of books and
inscriptions. It has no verbal parallels with
Goldsmith.
The remaining two-thirds of the essay are linked
to The Citizen of the World, Letter 89 (Works, ii,
p. 361, where the relevant passage from the Weekly
is quoted), and more firmly to Letter 108: ‘In the
most savage parts of India, they are possessed of
the secret of dying vegetable substances scarlet;
and likewise that of refining lead into a metal
which, for hardness and colour, is little inferior to
silver’ (Works, ii, pp. 418–9). Compare: ‘That mixed
metal called tutaneg, which so nearly resembles
silver, comes from the East, and we are entirely
ignorant of the manner in which it is made . . . Some
drugs . . . the method of dying leather scarlet . . . are
all secrets that might be procured by industry and
address’ (p. 55). Moreover, when the writer
suddenly asks ‘Would not a knowledge of medicine
and music be sufficient to carry a man thro’ the
most barren countries?’ (p. 54), we cannot but
notice that these are precisely the qualifications
that Goldsmith could, with some justification, claim
for himself.
The evidence from our tests is contradictory.
Scores are favourable for linguistic features,
but negative for sentence-length. A little more
negative evidence is provided by the adverb still,
averaging five occurrences in 750 words, whereas
no Goldsmith sample has more than two.
This unstructured, unpolished piece is unworthy
to be called an essay. Seven of its thirty-three
sentences begin with a limp ‘There are’, ‘There
seems’, ‘It were well’ (or ‘well worth’), and the like,
while its numerous rhetorical questions give it an
importunate air: ‘Might not the inland parts of
Africa be known . . . ?’ ‘Could not China be easily
seen . . . ?’ Declining to invoke the ‘argument from
quality’ we conclude that Goldsmith has to take
some responsibility for what is probably a joint
production. If, as seems likely, he consulted it
when he prepared his Chinese philosopher’s reflec-
tions on the benefits of travel (Letter 108), he
fashioned from some of its elements a more
temperate and elegant composition.
6.8 ‘A Sublime Passage in a French
Sermon’ (d9)
The ‘sublime passage’ had already been quoted in
the Bee’s article ‘Of Eloquence’ (Works, i, p. 479),
while ‘Some Remarks on the modern Manner of
Preaching’, which appeared just three numbers
later in the Weekly, and which is certainly
Goldsmith’s, could justifiably have been entitled
‘Another sublime Passage . . . ’. These three essays
are so intimately connected that Friedman judged
Goldsmith’s authorship of this piece to be ‘very
highly probable’. Our results endorse his verdict.
6.9 ‘The Futility of Criticism’ (d10)
Our results are favourable, and we can add a
further parallel to the very persuasive ones listed
by Friedman: ‘the critics of the Augustan period
. . . were all for harmony, short periods, and such
prose as might be sung as well as spoken’ (p. 61;
Works, iii, p. 53). Compare, from Polite Learning, ‘a
declamation, that might be sung as well as spoken’
(Works, i, p. 268), and from the Bee: Roman orators
whose ‘periods . . . were so harmonious, that they
could be sung as well as spoken’ (Works, i, p. 464).

6.10 ‘On the present State of our
Theatres’ (d11)
Goldsmith had used the image of a ‘losing gamester’
when reviewing Home’s Douglas, and consistently
expressed dissatisfaction with the taste of contem-
porary audiences (Friedman), as well as hostility
to ‘the character of harlequin and pantomime
in general’ (Golden). Friedman cautiously
admitted this piece to the Works (iii, p. 54, n. 1).
Our favourable results lead us to be rather more
welcoming.
6.11 ‘The Modern Taste in Music
considered’ (d12)
Friedman noted, first, a small connection between
this essay and ‘Of the Opera in England’, the last
item in the Bee; the complaints about over-extended
vocal ornaments are, in our view, not distinctive
enough to bear much weight. He demonstrated,
secondly, far more substantial links with ‘On the
Different Schools of Music’, published only fourteen
days later in the British Magazine. If there were
good grounds for attributing this second essay to
Goldsmith, the case for d12 might be strengthened.
But ‘Schools of Music’ (our d17) has no parallels
with genuine work, and negative scores for
linguistic features. It also contains a very visible
marker in the word though, which occurs seven
times in 868 words, a ratio of 1:124; the corpus has a
ratio of 1:866. More important, five of the seven
occurrences are in though . . . yet constructions:
‘though [Handel’s] English oratorios are accounted
inimitable, yet his Italian operas are fallen into
oblivion’ (Works, iii, p. 93). In the essay the
frequency ratio for this construction is 1:174
words. The corpus has a total of eleven such
constructions, or one in 3,465 words. Since its
own authenticity is, to say the least, uncertain,
this essay cannot be used to authenticate another
doubtful text.
To return to ‘The Modern Taste in Music’:
it looks, on all counts, even less like a Goldsmith
essay, with an unequivocally negative score for
linguistic features and no more than a borderline
one for sentence-length. There are no verbal
parallels, with the exception of a small but
remarkable bond with Goldsmith’s essay ‘On the
modern Manner of Preaching’, published just a
fortnight later in the Weekly. ‘Taste in Music’ admits
that ‘All these remarks are so trite, that it almost
demands an apology to repeat them. Yet trite as
they are . . . ’ (p. 95). ‘On . . .Preaching’ confesses
that Horace’s ‘Si vis me flere . . . ’ is ‘so trite
a quotation that it almost demands an apology
to repeat it; yet though all allow . . . ’ (p. 4; Works,
iii, p. 12). Perhaps Goldsmith unthinkingly repro-
duced a wording which had caught his eye in the
earlier number. Or he may be using a conventional
formula, a kind of ‘modesty topos’.
The close relationship in content and phrasing
between ‘Taste in Music’ and ‘Schools of Music’
suggests a common authorship. Stylometric tests,
and the absence of definite parallels further suggest
that Goldsmith is unlikely to be the author of
either essay. We believe that Friedman was right to
exclude ‘Taste in Music’ from the canon,
and wonder whether ‘Schools of Music’ deserves a
place there.
6.12 [A letter on Gamesters] (d13)
All our results are decidedly negative. As the most
unlike Goldsmith of all the doubtfuls, it is the most
unlikely to be his. There is, however, an interesting
complication. As Lonsdale points out, the piece
contains ‘striking anticipations’ of passages in a
long, cautionary letter on the same subject, from
Richard (‘Beau’) Nash to an unnamed lord;
the letter is reproduced in Goldsmith’s Life of
Nash, 1762 (Lonsdale, 1986, p. 223; Works, iii,
pp. 379–88). Prior suspected that Nash’s letter was
actually written by Goldsmith, but as Friedman
observed, ‘It would not seem easy to prove
or disprove this assertion’ (Works, iii, p. 379 n. 2).
We are unable to help. The sternly admonitory
tone is too remote from anything in the corpus
to allow a valid comparison. The letter is said
to have been ‘prepared by [Nash] for the press’,
a statement which could well conceal some rewrit-
ing by his biographer. We conjecture that in
remodelling Nash’s manuscript, Goldsmith remem-
bered the ‘Letter on Gamesters’ (it deals with a topic
close to his heart), looked it up, and transferred
several relevant sentences to Richard Nash.

6.13 ‘A Concise History and Reflections
upon modern Painting’ (d14)
In this translation nine sentences in the French
original are split into two or three English ones.
This procedure was certainly a feature of
Goldsmith’s method as a translator, to judge from
the three items in the Bee scrupulously analysed by
Graham Gargett (Gargett, 2003, pp. 843–5, 851).
But here the lengths of the twenty-two sentences
available for testing are not convincingly like
Goldsmith. There is, too, less freedom in the
rendering than he normally allows himself.
Roger Lonsdale attributes the translation to
Goldsmith (Lonsdale, 1986, p. 221). We cannot
press our frail evidence too hard, but on balance it
seems rather unlikely that he was responsible.
The original is an article in volume five of the
Encylopedie. Goldsmith’s familiarity with, and
exploitation of this volume is well attested
(see, for example, Friedman, 1935, p. 285, and
Works, iii, p. 90, n.l); the idea of translating the
material may have originated with him.
6.14 ‘Some Rules by which a Man
may appear learned’ (d15)
The author’s antipathy to metaphysics is shared
by Goldsmith, though also by several contempor-
aries (Golden; Works, i, p. 271; ii, p. 265; v, p. 294).
In an early review he mocks the pedant who takes
‘refuge behind Arabic’ (Works, i, p. 161); so here:
‘Two or three words of Arabic in the oriental
character would be of great use, men commonly
love to look upon Arabic’ (pp. 13–4). Perhaps
suggestive of Goldsmith’s authorship is the twist
given to a (slightly misquoted) line from Pope’s
Essay on Criticism: ‘If unexpectedly a book
should give you pleasure . . . be very phlegmatic in
its praise; fools may admire but men of sense
approve’ (p. 13). In this context ‘approve’ means
no more than to accord grudgingly the faintest of
faint praise, whereas in the original it is to give
judicious and sincere approbation. Compare,
from the Bee: ‘As for the polite, they are so very
polite, as never to applaud [a literary work]
upon any account. One of these, with a face
screwed up into affectation, tells you, that fools
may admire, but men of sense only approve’ (Works,
i, p. 417). Finally, the items in Goldsmith’s
‘Specimen of a Magazine’ include two brief sets of
lighthearted rules (Works, iii, pp. 193–4, and see
pp. 15–6 for another humorous set).
Scores for both sentence-length and linguistic
features are favourable, thus supporting Lonsdale’s
attractive suggestion that the ‘Rules’ were
the promised sequel, hurriedly prepared, to ‘The
Futility of Criticism’ (our d10; Lonsdale, 1986,
p. 222).
6.15 ‘Theatrical Amusements’ (d16)
‘There has been this season a sharp contention
between our two theatrical managers for the
favour of the town; pantomime has been opposed
to farce, and wire-walking to puppet-shew’ (p. l4).
The opening sentence echoes the ‘similar
ironic emphasis on theatrical ‘‘opposition’’ at the
beginning of the ‘‘Present State of the Theatres’’ ’
(our d11; Lonsdale, 1986, p. 222). Goldsmith’s
Chinese philosopher is likewise amused by the
hostilities at the start of the following theatrical
season (Works, ii, pp. 323–4). Our tests indicate
that this item could be Goldsmith’s. There are,
however, no further parallels with his work, while
the second half of the piece manifests some
striking dissimilarities. To describe The Tempest
as ‘one of the most pleasing productions of the
creative imagination of Shakespear’ (p. 15) does not
square with the very qualified praise of
Shakespearian drama, which Goldsmith had
expressed only nine months earlier in Polite
Learning(Works, iii, p. 326). And the account
of The Way to Keep Him is almost entirely plot-
summary, something that Goldsmith eschews in his
dramatic criticism (e.g. Works, i, pp. 10–12, 170–79
[probably, though not certainly, his] and 450–52).
This item has the air of a joint production,
probably stitched together in haste, with
Goldsmith responsible for the first two paragraphs,
the remainder being the work of the same
contributor who rather unkindly revisited, just
two pages later, the unfortunate premiere of
The Desert Island.

7 Conclusion
Morris Golden perceived a stylistic discrepancy
between the introductory paragraphs and the
central section of the ‘Manners of the Irish’. This
prompted him to suggest that ‘Goldsmith was
employed by the periodical partly to do editorial
work and that he touched up or added to the
work of others’, procedures which Golden also
suspected in the ‘Memoirs of Berkeley’. Our
analyses reinforce his suspicions in both cases,
while the life of Boyle is perhaps another example
of touching up. Such intervention, as we have seen,
was standard editorial practice. Goldsmith, in an
editorial capacity, could have proposed the transla-
tion from the Encyclopedie which appeared as
‘Modern Painting’, and three other features of
the journal may point to his role in gathering
material and shaping policy (We are mindful of
Johnson’s observation on a certain Shakespearian
commentator who ‘did not easily miss what he
desired to find’: Johnson, 1968, p. 83).
(i) Whether or not Goldsmith wrote the piece
about discoveries in remote countries, its position as
the lead item in the third number perhaps reflects
his strong interest in the topic.
(ii) The first article in the second number is
a translation from Voltaire entitled ‘Considerations
upon History’, while the longest single item in the
journal is an abridged translation of his recently
published Socrate (pp. 85–95). They may both owe
their presence to Goldsmith’s great admiration for
Voltaire. He had already written his ‘Memoirs of
Voltaire’, the life, as he described it to his brother
Henry, of a ‘very extraordinary man’ (Balderston,
1928, p. 63).
(iii) A brief ‘Word to the Reader’ introduces the
sixth number:
Even while we strive to solicit attention by a
preface, we are conscious of the futility of our
endeavour. All that we can promise has been
promised by others already; nothing that we
can attempt but former literary adventurers
have aimed at. We must appeal therefore from
our plan to our execution; we would rest the
merits of our claim upon that only, and could
wish to find applause, less from the novelty of
our design, than our care in conducting it . . . .
To say more would be a tax upon the reader’s
patience; to say less, would be injustice to
ourselves.
The text is too short (271 words) to be amenable
to our tests. We may, however, compare a sentence
in the later ‘Specimen of a Magazine’: ‘To say more
in favour of the INFERNAL MAGAZINE, would be
unworthy the Publick; to say less, would be
injurious to ourselves’ (Works, iii, p. 192). This
parallel, together with the balance and poise of the
writing, and the suave modesty of the tone incline
us to attribute this short preface to Goldsmith.
What the ‘Word to the Reader’ went on to
promise was an injection of new energy and
a revamped format. But there was a shortage
of readers willing to be addressed, and the journal
was about to fold. Goldsmith appears to have
contributed nothing original to the fourth and fifth
numbers, although a humorous petition from the
‘Goddess of Silence’, reprinted from the Public
Ledger, is probably his (Dixon and Mannion, 2001,
p. 315); in the week between numbers four and
five he was occupied in launching the ‘Chinese
Letters’ in that journal. Yet with characteristic
generosity he then threw himself into a last-ditch
attempt to save the Weekly. Besides his probable
contributions—‘Rules to appear learned’, part of
‘Theatrical Amusements’ and the introductory
‘Word to the Reader’—Goldsmith’s share in the
final number includes the substantial discussion of
‘the modern Manner of Preaching’ which he
reprinted in Essays. The almost absurd overlap
between this piece and the ‘French Sermon’ essay
(d9) of three weeks before, suggests that Goldsmith
originally intended it for another journal. The Royal
Magazine and the British, to both of which he had
very recently contributed, are strong candidates.
In their pages the plea for earnest pulpit delivery
would not have tasted like a reheated dish, nor is it
likely that the (unconscious?) repetition of the
modesty formula from the essay on music would
have been spotted.
The extent of Goldsmith’s involvement in the
Weekly, as both ‘editorial worker’ and contributor
remains uncertain. We can be categorical only about
the three items—two essays and a poem—which he

later reprinted. It is, however, highly probable
that he was the author of ‘Thoughts on Peace’,
‘A sublime Passage in a French Sermon’, ‘The
Futility of Criticism’, and ‘On the present State of
our Theatres’, for all of which Friedman was a
persuasive advocate. It is quite possible that he
wrote the ‘Introduction’, ‘The History of Regnard’,
and ‘Rules to appear learned’. We would grant
him only a collaborative role, though not a
subordinate one, in the essay on discoveries to be
made in remote countries, and in ‘Theatrical
Amusements’, and restrict him to an editorial role
in ‘Manners of the Irish’ and the lives of
Berkeley and Boyle. Even at the most conservative
estimate, this represents a not inconsiderable
contribution to this short-lived magazine, and a
serious attempt to keep it afloat at a time when he
was busy with other journalistic work. We must
admit that none of the pieces we have examined
represents him at his best, but ‘of such a writer
even in his more careless effusions, who would
willingly lose anything?’ (Prior, 1837, i, p. 345).
