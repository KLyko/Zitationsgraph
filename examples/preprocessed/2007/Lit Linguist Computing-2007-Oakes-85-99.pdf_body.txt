The first study to use an objective measure, the
chi-squared test, to observe which words were more
typical of a sample of American English as opposed
to a sample of British English, was performed by
Hofland and Johansson (1982). Leech and Fallon
(1992) later used the same measure to examine
differences in the vocabulary of the Brown Corpus
(one million words of American English) and the

Lancaster–Oslo–Bergen corpus (LOB, consisting of
one million words of British English) in fifteen
different categories, such as sport, transport and
travel, and business. They regarded some of the
differences in vocabulary they found as indicative of
differences in spelling (e.g. color and colour), lexical
choice (e.g. gasoline and petrol), and proper nouns
associated with the two countries (e.g. Chicago was
more common in the US texts and London was
more common in the British texts). Such differences
they referred to as linguistic contrasts. All other
differences they referred to as non-linguistic
contrasts, which they regarded as indicators of
socio-cultural differences between the two coun-
tries. The LOB and Brown corpora contain English
used in the 1960s. More recently corresponding
corpora called Freiburg–LOB (FLOB) and Freiburg–
Brown (Frown) have been compiled from English
of the 1990s. The work of Leech and Fallon has been
repeated using the FLOB and Frown corpora by
Oakes (2003). In this study, the comparison of
a corpus of American English with a corpus of
British English has been extended to include
samples of written English from other countries,
namely Australia, India, Kenya, New Zealand,
and Tanzania. In the US, Britain, Australia, and
New Zealand, English is spoken as a first language,
while in India and East Africa it is mainly spoken as
a second language (Crystal, 1997). English is used as
a lingua franca in both Kenya and Tanzania. In both
countries, English is used in secondary and tertiary
education, and in the High Court. In Tanzania,
Kiswahili is used in Parliament and Government
institutions, but in such situations in Kenya, English
would be used. (Hudson-Ettle and Schmied, 1999).
All the samples may be found on the ICAME CD
(Hofland et al., 1999), as shown in Table 1. The total
number of words in all seven corpora combined
is 5,380,477. Five of the corpora are balanced with
respect to each other, containing approximately
the same proportions of fiction, newspaper text,
and so on, as shown in Table 2. This data was
obtained from the ICAME disc manuals and
the Wellington corpus website. The reason the
Australian corpus contains fewer words than the
other four, in Table 2, is that only those sections
for which copyright permission letters could be
obtained were placed on the ICAME disc (Hofland,
personal communication).
As shown in Table 3, the Kenyan and Tanzanian
corpora are balanced with respect to each other, but
not with respect to the other five corpora used
in this study. Although available on the ICAME
disc, they were originally produced for the ICE
(see www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice). For this
study, the collections of East African printed texts
were used.
2 Method: The Chi-Squared Test
We construct a contingency table with rows
corresponding to words and columns correspond-
ing to corpora. In the cell corresponding to word W
in corpus C, we enter the number of occurrences of
W in C. We wish to compare the frequency
distributions of words between corpora. In partic-
ular, we will test the null hypothesis that the
underlying probability distributions for English
from the five different countries are equal.
The usual test to compare frequency distribu-
tions in a contingency table is the chi-squared test.
Usually, a random sample is taken from each
of a number of populations and the frequency,
within each sample, of each of a number of
categories is recorded. The set of frequencies for
one sample then has a multinomial distribution
(Plackett, 1981). For large samples, the usual test
statistic has approximately a chi-squared
distribution under the null hypothesis that the

underlying populations are equal. For the purpose
of this approximation, a sample is usually
regarded as sufficiently large if every cell in the
table has an expected frequency of at least 5
under the null hypothesis (see, for example,
Altman 1991, Section 10.6.8). In this study,
words giving rise to expected frequencies of less
than 5 are omitted.
The sampling process in our case falls short of
this ideal because the sampling units are not
individual words but documents of about 2,000
words each. The five balanced corpora each contain
500 such documents. This causes two problems:
(1) The rates of occurrence of particular words
may differ from document to document.
(2) Words in sequence in a document are not
independent random samples. Rather, we
might regard each document as the realisation
of a stochastic process.
We intend to examine both of these difficulties in
more detail in a future work. For now we argue that
our main conclusions are unlikely to have been
significantly affected. The large number of docu-
ments in a corpus tends to reduce any effect of
either problem. We give further consideration to
problem (1) in Section 2.1 below. The main
implication of problem (2) is that if, for example,
two words tend to occur together, the frequencies of
occurrence of these two words are not independent.
This affects the true significance level of the test.
However, the effect is to make the test conservative.
That is, when the null hypothesis is true, the
probability of getting a result which is apparently
significant at the % level is actually <%. This has

been confirmed in simulation studies by the
authors. The same is true if occurrences of two
words are negatively correlated, perhaps because
they are used as alternatives.
A third potential difficulty is the fact that
each corpus contains literature in several different
categories. It may be that the distinguishing
characteristics of the different national varieties
of English literature differ between categories,
suggesting that it might be better to sum chi-
squared statistics calculated separately for each
category. Again, we will discuss this point in a
future work but, since our present aim is to identify
overall typical words, we do not disaggregate in
this way in this study.
In the first experiment, a comparison of the
vocabulary in the five closely balanced corpora
of Australia, Britain, India, New Zealand, and
United States was made. In the second experiment,
a comparison of the vocabulary present in all seven
corpora was made, although in this case some of the
differences found in the Kenyan and Tanzanian
might be due to the fact that they were compiled
using a different sampling strategy to the other
five corpora. In both experiments, first an overall
chi-squared value was found to test the null
hypothesis that there was no significant difference
in the vocabulary distribution of each corpus. Then
the standardised residual for each word type in each
corpus was examined to find the words that occurred
significantly more often in any of the corpora.
To determine the overall chi-squared value for
the five balanced corpora, a computer program was
written to construct a contingency table with five
columns (one for each corpus) and 101,984
rows (one for each distinct word type found
in any of the corpora). In these experiments,
a word was defined as a string of consecutive
alphabetic and numeric characters, and all
upper case characters were converted to lower
case. The contingency table entries for three word
types, a, commonwealth, and zzzzooop, are shown
in Table 4.
The values in the contingency table are the
number of occurrences of each word token in each
corpus, which are called the observed frequencies
(O). The column totals are the number of words in
the entire corpus, and the row totals are the number
of times the word appears across all five corpora.
There is no requirement that either all the column
totals or all the row totals must be identical. The
chi-squared test makes no assumption of equal
sample sizes and is valid even if the sample sizes
are very different, sample sizes being taken into
account in the calculation of the chi-squared
statistic (see, for example, Bain and Engelhardt,
1987, Section 13.5); so we can work with different
sized corpora and words of different overall
frequencies. The grand total is the total number of
word tokens across the five corpora, and is both the
sum of the column totals and the sum of the row
totals. The next stage is to calculate a corresponding
expected frequency (E) for each observed frequency.
The expected frequencies take into account that the
corpora are of different sizes and that the words are
of different frequencies, and are calculated using
the formula expected frequency¼ row total column
total/grand total. For example, the expected
frequency of commonwealth in the ACE corpus is
249 767,579/4,893,056¼ 39.06. The expected
values for each of the observed values shown in
Table 4 are shown in Table 5.
For a word type to be considered further in this
analysis, its expected frequency in each corpus must

be at least 5. Thus the word zzzzooop makes no
contribution to the final chi-squared value.
The third step is to calculate for each cell the
quantity (O E)2/E. For the word commonwealth
in the ACE corpus, this gives (164 39.06)2/
39.06¼ 399.63. The greater the difference between
the observed and expected frequency, the more
evidence we have that some words are relatively
more frequent in some corpora than others. The
(O E)2/E values corresponding to each cell in
Table 5 are shown in Table 6.
The (O E)2/E values for every word type in
each corpus are added together to produce an
overall chi-squared value of 414,916.81. The
number of degrees of freedom for a contingency
table is the (number of rows 1) multiplied by
the (number of columns 1); in this case
101,983 4¼ 407,932. For this overall chi-squared
value with this number of degrees of freedom,
we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no
difference in the vocabulary distribution of the
five balanced corpora at the 0.1% level of
significance.
Having determined that there is strong evidence
for the existence of genuine differences in the
frequencies of the words in the five varieties of
English literature, the next stage is to look for
individual cases where an individual word occurs
more often in a corpus than would be expected
under the null hypothesis of equal distributions.
The approach we take here is to examine the
standardised residual (O E)2/
ffiffiffi
E
p
in each cell
(Haberman, 1973). The square of the standardised
residual, (O E)2/E, is the contribution of that cell
to the overall statistic, as shown in Table 6. It is
easily shown that, under the null hypothesis, the
mean of the distribution of the standard residual is
0 and its standard deviation is 1. Further, in
moderately large samples, where E is at least 5, the
distribution is approximately normal. Although the
standardised residuals are not strictly independent
of each other, in a large table, the dependence is
very slight, and in any case, does not invalidate
our procedure described below.
In this study, we consider only those words
which are typical of corpora, where the observed
frequency of that word in a corpus is greater than
the expected frequency. We can produce a ranking
of all the words in each corpus, according to the
standardised residuals. We check whether each
standardised residual is statistically significant by
assuming that, under the null hypothesis, they have
approximately a standard normal distribution,
and applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparison procedures, as will be described in
Section 2.1.
When all the distinct words (types) in the
Australian corpus are placed in order of greatest
chi-squared value first, we obtain the list of the top
20 words most typical of the Australian corpus given
in Table 7. The word itself is in the first column, its
frequency in each corpus is given in columns 2–6,
and its standardised residual in the ACE corpus is
given in the final column.

in any of the other corpora. A method of filtering
out such terms is to reject all words with low
dispersion (where most occurrences of the word are
clumped together) as estimated by a statistical
measure of dispersion such as Juilland’s D measure
(Lyne, 1986). The use of this measure, which also
filters out the word ewes, will be described further
in Section 2.2.
2.1 Controlling the false discovery rate
In examining the table of standardised residuals
for significant values, we are effectively performing
as many comparisons as there are cells in the
contingency table. If we use a significance level of
0.001 to determine if each word is typical of each
corpus, one in a thousand comparisons will appear
positive purely by chance. With a contingency table
of 509,920 cells, where, in fact, there are no
underlying deviations from the null hypothesis, we
might expect about 500 occurrences where a word
is spuriously deemed typical of a corpus. This
problem of multiple testing can be addressed by
adjusting the significance levels of the individual
tests. A commonly used method is the Bonferroni
correction (Miller, 1981). This controls the
‘familywise error rate’ (FWER), that is the
probability of rejecting at least one out of m
multiple hypotheses when all are, in fact, true. We
can obtain an FWER 100 % by testing each of
the individual hypotheses at the 100 /m level.
The Bonferroni correction is ‘conservative’ in
that it errs on the side of non-significance. Further,
the FWER is not the most appropriate measure
for our purpose. More appropriate is the ‘false
discovery rate’ (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995). This is the expected value of the
proportion of the rejected null hypotheses which
are in fact, true. In our case it is the expected value
of the proportion of the words identified as typical,
which have been erroneously identified. Benjamini
and Hochberg proposed a method for controlling
the FDR. It is easily seen that any hypothesis
rejected using the Bonferroni correction for an
FWER of 100 % would also be rejected under the
Benjamini and Hochberg procedure for an FDR of
100 %. (The converse is not true.) A modification
of the FDR procedure, called the ‘positive false
discovery rate’, which gives greater power, is
described by Storey (2002).

To identify the words listed in Section 3 below,
we simply used the Bonferroni correction to give an
FWER of not more than 0.001 (i.e. 0.1%). Therefore
the FDR will also not be >0.1%. In comparing
the vocabulary of the five balanced corpora, we
effectively perform 509,920 tests because there are
101,984 unique word types across the corpora, each
tested once for each corpus. To find the appropriate
critical value of the standard normal distribution,
we divided 0.001 by 509,920 to give an adjusted
significance level of 1.961 109. For a one-sided
test, since we are only considering positive residuals,
the critical value of the standard normal distribu-
tion is 5.89. The corresponding value from the chi-
squared distribution of one degree of freedom for
the individual contributions to the chi-squared
statistic is 34.66, which is 5.892. We then identify
words with positive standard residuals greater than
5.89 or chi-squared contributions above 34.66.
This procedure ensures that, on average, not
>0.1% of the words selected using that will have
been incorrectly identified, subject, of course, to
the proviso that the normal distribution is a good
approximation in this case.
The WordSmith corpus analysis package (Scott,
1999) has a ‘keywords’ feature, which uses the chi-
squared test to identify words which occur with an
unusually high frequency in an analysis corpus with
respect to a reference corpus. It would have been
possible to compare each national corpus against
a reference corpus consisting of all the remaining
national corpora. The method used in this study
allows all seven national corpora to be simulta-
neously compared, and overcomes the problem
that with the WordSmith method, the tests for
individual words are not strictly independent of
one another. For example, if we had two 100-word
corpora, we might compare the use of Word A
across the corpora, and find that it occurred
50 times in Corpus 1 and 20 times in Corpus 2.
Then, in a second statistical test, we compare the
frequency of Word B across the two corpora. This
second comparison is not altogether independent
of the first, because there are only 50 slots left in
Corpus 1 where Word B could possibly occur
(given what we know from the first statistical test).
Thus there must be some interdependence among
the statistical tests for each word. A much greater
problem is the FDR. When making a large number
of comparisons (one for each word in each corpus),
we will inevitably get some false positives purely
by chance. We implement Bonferroni’s correction
to control the FDR.
2.2 Dispersion
Dispersion measures show how evenly or otherwise
a word is distributed throughout a corpus (Lyne,
1985, 1986). In a study of this nature, it is important
to consider only those words which are relatively
evenly spread throughout the corpus. Considering
the chi-squared measure alone, it would seem that
the 15th most typical word of British English is
thalidomide. However, all 55 occurrences of
this word in the FLOB corpus are found in a
single article entitled ‘Thalidomide treatment for
chronic graft-versus-host disease’. This suggests
that the appearance of thalidomide so high in the
chi-squared list is more a function of sampling
decision to include that particular article than the
fact that the word is genuinely typical of British
English.
The simplest measure of dispersion is the
range, which is the number of subsections of
the corpus the word appears in. For example, if
the FLOB corpus is divided into five consecutive
subsections of equal length, thalidomide appears
55 times in the fourth subsection, but no times at
all in any of the other subsections. The range is
the number of subsections that contains the word
at least once, which is just one for thalidomide.
The word England, which, considering chi-squared
value alone, would be the 14th most typical word
of British English, occurs 106, 61, 78, 27, and
27 times, respectively, in each subsection, and thus
has a range of 5. Since this word appears in all five
subsections of the corpus, we can be more confident
that it really does occur more often in British
English than in corpora of other Englishes.
A more sophisticated measure of dispersion is
Juilland’s D (Juilland et al., 1970), originally
developed for Spanish texts, which takes into
account not only the presence or absence of a
word in each subsection of the corpus, but the exact
number of times it appears. In Lyne’s (1985)

subsections, which is the approach followed in this
study. The subsections are based on splitting the
texts in their category-based order—for example,
Section 1 contains texts A01, A02, A03, etc. Taking
the word Commonwealth in the Australian corpus,
we find that it occurs 164 times altogether: 31 times
in the first subsection, 8 times in the second,
32 times in the third, 88 times in the fourth, and
5 times in the final one. Thus, although the word
appears in all subsections of the corpus, it is not
altogether evenly distributed, as the majority of
occurrences are found in the fourth subsection. The
mean number of times the word occurs in each
subsection is 164/5¼ 32.8. To find the standard
deviation of the number of times the word is found
in each subsection, we use the formula

To account for the fact that the standard
deviation tends to be higher for more frequent
words, the standard deviation is divided by the
mean frequency to give a coefficient of variation
called V:
V ¼ s
mean
¼ 29:79
32:8
¼ 0:908
The coefficient of dispersion, D, is derived from
V, and is designed to fall in the range 0 (where
all occurrences of a word are clumped in the
same subsection) to 1 (where the word is distributed
perfectly, evenly throughout the corpus).

Juilland also describes a usage coefficient U,
which combines dispersion and frequency. For
Commonwealth, this would be 0.546 164¼ 89.5.
The chi-squared test can also be used as a
measure of evenness of distribution (Lyne, 1985,
p. 117). The observed values (one for each subsection
of the corpus) are the subfrequencies of the word in
each subsection. The expected value (which we
would find if the word was distributed perfectly
evenly throughout the corpus) for each subsection
is the total frequency of the word divided by
the number of subsections. Since, when using
the chi-squared test, there is a requirement that
all the expected values are at least five, the test
can only be used for words with a total frequency
in the corpus of at least five times the number
of subsections. Chi-squared value will be 0 if the
word is evenly dispersed throughout the
corpus, and a positive value otherwise. If five
subsections are used, we have 5 1¼ 4 degrees of
freedom, and a chi-squared value greater than
13.28 will lead to rejection of the hypothesis
that the word is evenly distributed at the 1% level
of significance.
Whether we use range, D, or U, our cut-off
point for discriminating between well and poorly
dispersed words must be arbitrary. To estimate
suitable cut-off points or thresholds, consider the
following table of the 25 proper nouns with the
greatest chi-squared values in the FLOB corpus,
shown in Table 8.
We have placed an asterisk in the second column
for each proper noun we subjectively would not
expect to be typical of a British English corpus.
The columns headed S1–S5 are the number of
times each word occurred in each subsection of
the corpus. With the exception of Gorbachev and
Kinnock, where intermediate results were obtained,
the proper nouns could be automatically classified
using dispersion measures. All the proper nouns

we felt were typical of British texts had a range of
4 or 5, while the others had a range of 1 or 2.
Juilland’s D was 0.44 or more for all the proper
nouns we felt were typical of British texts, while
for the other proper nouns it was 0.18 or less.
U was greater than 23 for the proper nouns we
considered typical of a British text, and less than six
for the others. As a result of this small study, we felt
that a combined cut-off point of 3 for range and
0.3 for Juilland’s D should be used to determine
the well-distributed words from the rest for the
remainder of this work. The WordSmith corpus
analysis tool has a ‘plot’ feature, which shows
graphically how words are distributed throughout
a corpus. In this study, we quantify the degree
of dispersion with numeric methods, and also
estimate a cut-off point below which we can say
that a word is insufficiently dispersed throughout a
corpus to be considered typical of the corpus as a
whole.
3 The Vocabulary Most Typical
of Each of the Corpora
The 50 words most typical of each of the five
balanced corpora studied as ordered by their
contributions to the overall chi-squared value
(where Juilland’s dispersion measure D is at least
0.3 and the word appears in at least three out of
five subsections) are shown in Table 9. Altogether,
the number of words with a chi-squared contribu-
tion above 34.66 with sufficient range and disper-
sion were 166 for the ACE corpus, 127 for FLOB,
249 for Frown, 348 for Kolhapur, and 160 for the
Wellington corpus.
In the Australian sample, 18 of the 19 words
with highest chi-squared values are the names of
Australian people and places. The exception is
Commonwealth (2¼ 399.6)—Australia is the only
Commonwealth country in this study to have

this term in its list of the 50 most significant words,
probably due to the use of the phrase
Commonwealth of Australia. Other significant
terms in the Australian corpus are mining (189.1)
and wool (141.1). Two terms relate to the political
system, Premier (143.4) and Senator (162.7), as well
as the names of the individual politicians Hawke
(394.0) and Whitlam (146.0) and the political
parties ALP (181.3), Labor (126.5), and BHP
(119.0). A number of terms refer to employment
rights: unions (146.1), unemployed (133.6) and
superannuation (89.1). The Australian list also
includes a local broadcaster, ABC (123.0), and
lower down the list, the (Sydney) Herald (44.9).
An artefact of the ACE corpus layout was that a
number of words were split across two lines,
resulting in certain prefixes and suffixes
(con-, com-, -tion, -ing, and -ment) having high
(O E)2/E values, since they occurred only in the
ACE corpus. These were not included in Table 9.
The most significant terms typical of British
English were mainly the names of British people and
places. NHS (National Health Service) (192.2) and
BBC (British Broadcasting Company) (184.3) are
British institutions. Other terms, Tory (165.7), royal
(150.0), and Labour (181.6) refer to government,
where the Tory party is a nickname for the
Conservative Party. Individual politicians found in

the list are Thatcher (222.6) and Churchill (83.6),
and although not a British politician, Gorbachev
(132.6) is mentioned widely in the British texts. EC
(123.8) stands for European Community. Two terms
related to historical epochs, century (142.5) and
eighteenth (76.0) appear in the British corpus. The
most striking feature of the British list, also found
in the study by Leech and Fallon, was the presence
of so many aristocratic titles. Duke (89.4), Earl
(55.0), Lord (105.9), Lords (102.1), Prince (102.9),
Princess (40.6), and Royal (150.0) all had (O E)2/E
values of over 34.66. No other corpus produced
any significant terms for aristocratic titles.
An artefact of the corpus mark-up conventions
used was the presence of pounds1 (153.8) and
pounds2 (121.3) for £1 and £2 in the list of
significantly British terms.
The terms typical of Indian English were again
mostly names of people and places, but the list also
includes Rs (1141.1), abbreviation for the currency
(Rupees), mn (563.6) for millions, crores (340.0)
and lakhs (202.8), indigenous Indian words for ten
million and ten thousand, respectively. Three entries
in the list refer to the caste system: caste (523.4),
castes (427.9), and dalit (98.4). The list for Indian
English also contains four high-frequency function
words: the (904.1), and (58.2), of (795.4), and in
(179.5). Kilgarriff (1996) writes that the appearance
of such words in such lists is an artefact of the chi-
squared test rather than a distinguishing feature
of a particular word sample. The Indian list of
significant words is the only one to contain terms
for clothes, being the indigenous term sari (196.9),
and also cloth (54.6) and shawl (49.4). An important
feature of the list of terms significantly typical
of the Indian corpus was the sheer number of
religious terms, and the variety of religions repre-
sented by them. These terms were: Buddha (86.0),
Buddhism (45.4), divine (150.6), Gita (119.3), God
(37.8), Gods (78.6), Goddess (44.4), Hindu (299.5),
Hindus (148.1), Karma (61.4), Muslim (151.8),
Muslims (42.2), mystic (53.1), Mystics (100.7),
pandit (104.4), puja (122.3), Saints (35.6), Sikh
(80.0), Swami (131.2), temple (248.8), temples
(104.2), Vedas (101.4), Vedic (102.9), yoga (97.7).
No other corpus had more than three significant
terms pertaining to religion. The Indian corpus was
the only one where upto (214.7) was spelt as a single
word.
The terms most typical of New Zealand English
are nearly all place names. Te (831.2) occurs in a
number of place names, such as Te Kuiti and
Te Anga. Lange (355.7) is a former Prime Minister,
and pakeha (620.4) is a Maori word for someone
of European descent. Rugby (235.9) is the sixteenth
most typical word of the WC, where other
significant sporting terms are batsman (41.2), golf
(34.2), players (126.1), and team (55.2). The
Australian corpus had the significant sporting
terms ski (92.0), and skiing (49.6). The Indian list
has tournament (47.3) and the US list has baseball
(125.2), but the British list has no significant
sporting terms. Another characteristic of the list of
terms typical of New Zealand English was the large
number of terms describing the natural world: bay
(225.6), beach (36.0), cliff (46.4), earthquake (61.9),
forest (138.2), harbour (158.3), island (222.3),
islands (136.5), lake (96.2), lakes (74.0), and
landscape (116.6) were all significant. The next
greatest number of terms pertaining to the natural
world, found in the Australian corpus, was four.
Three of the corpora had significant terms for
the flora and fauna found in those countries.
For New Zealand there were beech (157.5), fern
(57.2), and snail (63.3). For Australia there
was crocodile (42.4), and for India there were
bamboo (54.9), deer (52.5), elephant (112.9),
and tiger (44.4).
There are relatively few people and places in
the list of the 50 terms most typical of US English,
the largest category of words arising here due to
American spellings: toward (139.9), percent (807.1),
programs (526.7), defense (524.8), program (411.7),
color (311.3), behavior (332.8), labor (268.1),
fiber (255.8), gray (213.4), theater (167.7), favorite
(164.3), favor (150.5), colors (150.5), and
organization (141.6). The U (733.3) and S (759.4)
come from US. The US list contains terms from
the politics of inclusiveness: black (278.0), gender
(199.4), white (159.1), diversity (46.1), and gay
(40.7). The US list contained several typical terms
related to transport, but most of these were due to
lexical differences, since other terms would be
used for the same concepts in the other corpora.

These terms were traveled (108.8), pickup (93.4),
railroad (86.8), highway (90.2), transportation
(79.4), and truck (45.3).
The words most typical of the East African
corpora as determined by the comparison of seven
corpora are listed in Table 10. In the list of words
for Kenyan English, there are a number of references
to agriculture: pesticides (692.3), maize (605.5),
livestock (485.1), agricultural (360.4), farmers
(322.6), crops (318.2), food (313.7), farmer (224.9),
beans (174.2), agriculture (133.8), milk (120.4), and
planting (117.0) in the list of 50 words most typical
of the Kenyan corpus. Although there are no
agricultural terms in the top 50 for the Tanzanian
corpus, six such terms were found to be significant
lower down in the list. The difference in the number
of significant agricultural terms in the two East
African corpora was just significant (2¼ 3.87,
P< 0.05). In the comparison of the balanced
corpora, the Indian and Australian corpora also
had a number of significant terms for agriculture
(seven and five, respectively). EA (2027.1 in the
Kenyan corpus, 7633.4 in the Tanzanian) stands
for East Africa.
In the Tanzanian sample, the most significant
words refer to people and places, except for the
honorific Ndugu (3794.0), the political party CCM
(2114.2), and the local lingua franca Kiswahili
(797.3 in the Tanzanian corpus, 294.5 in the
Kenyan). The East African corpora have most
significant terms related to medicine. The Kenyan
corpus has malaria (606.3), drugs (217.5), disease
(197.2), and diseases (134.3) in the top 50, while the
Tanzanian corpus has HIV (1072.3), AIDS (562.2),
health (300.3), diseases (197.2), and malaria (278.6).
Only one significant educational term was found in
the five balanced corpora. There are very highly
significant terms for education present in both the
East African corpora: education (292.5), students
(197.7), and curriculum (171.1) in the Kenyan top
50, and university (519.1), education (300.6),
teaching (232.7), and academic (219.1) in the
Tanzanian top 50. Both corpora contain further
educational terms with lower, but still significant,
chi-squared contributions. Just two significant
educational terms were found in the five balanced
corpora. It is possible for the same word to be
typical of more than one corpus. An example of this
is Africa, which is typical of both the Kenyan (770.1)
and Tanzanian (647.8) corpora.
4 Conclusion
The goal of Leech and Fallon’s study was ‘using the
corpora as evidence of cultural differences’ between
Britain and the United States. Although we observed
clear differences in the vocabulary of each of our
seven corpora, we cannot necessarily conclude that
these are due to cultural differences between the

seven countries. Our approach has been to compare
vocabulary across corpora rather than cultures. The
reason is that we do not know that the sample of
texts included in any of the seven ICAME corpora
represents the full range of topics typical of the
associated culture. What we need are corpora
designed to represent the general topics and
vocabulary of cultures or dialects. This would
require methods to determine the range of topics
addressed in each culture, and then methods to
sample adequately from each topical domain. Here
we have a trade-off situation. Balanced corpora,
such as FLOB and Frown, are necessary for many
statistical comparisons. However, two corpora
designed to reflect the ranges of topics and styles
typical of two different cultures, might well not
contain the same range of topics and styles as each
other, and hence not be balanced. A difficulty with
categorising words as described in Section 4 is that
some of the categories overlap. For example, science
is a very broad category, which could include terms
for medicine or flora and fauna. In this study,
‘science’ is taken to mean ‘science excluding
medicine or flora and fauna’. With these caveats
in mind, the results of this study may be
summarised as follows:
The Indian corpus had both the greatest number of
significant religious terms and the greatest variety of
religions represented by those terms. The New
Zealand corpus had greatest number of significant
terms describing the natural world. The terms found
to be most typical of US English did not so much
reveal vocabulary differences between the US and
the other countries, but lexical differences due to
alternative spellings. Trudgill and Hannah (1994: 2)
describe the two main varieties of standard English
as being US and British English, with the other five
Englishes studied here as being more closely related
to British English. Words pertaining to education
and medicine appear to be more typical of the East
African corpora, but we must be guarded in making
this judgement since the text sampling strategy used
for the East African corpora was different to that
used for the other five corpora. In particular, the
East African corpora, unlike the other five, had
sections of newspaper texts (persuasive column
and persuasive editorial) which might contain
suggestions for policy in these three areas.
However, these two are the only significant East
African corpora currently available.
‘Simpson’s paradox refers to the reversal of
direction of a comparison or an association when
data from several groups are combined to form a
single group’ (Moore and McCabe, 1993: 190). The
actual reversal of direction of an association is an
extreme case of the phenomenon which might affect
a comparison of unbalanced corpora. In a less
extreme case, the strength of association might vary
between literature types. For example, the word goal
might be more common in sports coverage and
therefore if one corpus contains more sports
coverage, we might inadvertently think that ‘goal’
is more characteristic of that corpus. To avoid this
difficulty, the main problem with unbalanced
data, it would be possible to calculate a separate
chi-squared statistic in each literature category.
First these chi-squared values should be summed
to find a single overall value. The original degrees
of freedom should be multiplied by the number
of categories, enabling us to find whether there
is a significant difference between the corpora
or not. When looking at the individual
contributions of each word in each category to the
overall chi-squared value, we may find that some
significant words might not be significant in
every category.
Kilgarriff (1996) discusses the issue of ‘clumpi-
ness’, i.e. where a word has occurred in a text, the
chances of it occurring again increase, and hence the
words in a corpus are not altogether independent.
Similarly, words are not completely independent if
they form collocations, such as football and goal.
As discussed in Section 2, the effect of this is to
make our test more conservative.
This study has examined only single word
orthographic vocabulary differences between the
corpora used to represent the English used in seven
different countries. The chi-squared method is
readily amenable to identifying sequences of two
or more words typical of a corpus, possibly
identified by the incorporating multi-word expres-
sion (MWE) tools, but, as noted by Oakes (2003),
repeated word sequences are considerably more
rare in a corpus than repeated individual words.

Other studies examine the relative frequencies of
word lemmas, use stop lists or look at the relative
frequencies of collocations (Granger, 1998: 31). The
fact that labour is more typical of British English
and labor is more typical of US English is due
mainly to an orthographic difference, but also
because the Labour party is a major political party
in Britain. To examine the effect of this cultural
rather than the orthographic difference, it would be
possible to regard both orthographic forms as
equivalent, and to obtain 2 values for labor/
labour across the corpora.
This study has considered only words in isola-
tion. It would be interesting to conduct a deeper
study of potentially interesting words in context,
using a concordancer. This, for example, would
determine whether the names of towns such as
Dunedin and Invercargill are being used in a
geographic sense or in a sporting sense, where
they refer to their respective towns’ rugby or
cricket teams. Similarly, some of the proper names
might be the names of athletes, and in such cases
should be considered as sporting terms. Tagging
each potentially interesting word according to its
context would allow the use of the chi-squared test
to find which word-meanings rather than which
word-types are typical of a given corpus.
In this study, using the existing ICAME corpora
as far as possible, we have identified vocabulary
differences which can be used as potential discrim-
inators for an automatic classifier which classifies
texts of unknown provenance according to their
most likely variety of English. The methodology
described in this article will enable improved lists
of vocabulary differences to be derived from
cultural corpora, which represent the range of
topics found in a national variety, when these
become available.
