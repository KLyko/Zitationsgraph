This article employs the tools of statistics to
analyze various aspects of the fiction published in
the New Yorker magazine between 5 October 1992
and 17 September 2001. The analyses conducted
seek to answer two very different questions about
New Yorker fiction from this era, both of which can
be addressed using the same data set. The first
question this article attempts to answer is whether
changes in Executive Editors or Fiction Editors
are associated with significant changes in the type
of fiction published at the New Yorker. The second
question is whether New Yorker authors write fiction
about characters who are similar to themselves.
The New Yorker is the most prestigious, widely
read and frequently published literary magazine in
the world. Its influence on America’s cultural scene
is generally agreed to be unparalleled among publi-
cations of its genre, and since the early twentieth
century, aspiring as well as established writers have
viewed inclusion in its pages as one of the highest
honors attainable, offering the potential to launch
a literary career. In the past decade, the magazine
has published an average of 52 pieces of fiction
annually, selected through a process that necessarily
involves subjective editorial judgment but is
intended to be meritocratic. These stories are
viewed by literary critics and writers worldwide as
a sample of the most compelling modern short

fiction, although it should be noted that the
New Yorker does not necessarily publish a repre-
sentative sample of modern fiction. However, in
light of its unique characteristics as a literary
magazine that has consistently published what
most would argue to be the best contemporary
short fiction in a periodical, the New Yorker is an
ideal venue for analyzing modern short stories.
Of particular interest to the authors of this
article is the nature of the relationship between the
New Yorker’s editors and the magazine’s fictional
content. Since the submissions editors inspire and
the stories they subsequently choose to print
significantly shape the universe, at least domesti-
cally, of published short fiction in any given
month, year, or decade, gaining insight into what
type of influence, if any, editors exert over the
New Yorker’s fiction content seems a worthwhile
endeavor. For example, if the personal preferences
of editors—conscious or unconscious—or pressures
to satisfy particular audiences appear to influence
what fiction is printed in the New Yorker, an
exposure of trends in the fiction published by
different editors could lead to a better under-
standing of why New Yorker short fiction, and
perhaps short fiction more generally, has been
dominated in recent years by particular genres or
types of authors.
A second major unknown addressed in this article
is the extent to which authors write fiction about
characters similar to themselves, a question that has
been raised time and again about authors and their
work. Although literary criticism of individual pieces
often addresses the degree to which a writer has
drawn from personal experience, to our knowledge,
an attempt has never been made to analyze this
question with a large enough population to obtain
results with statistical significance. With the sizeable
amount of data available from 1990s New Yorker
fiction, it is possible to determine how often
New Yorker writers invent stories about characters
who resemble themselves, as well as which of their
own characteristics they most frequently project
onto their protagonists and secondary characters.
Essentially, this analysis will provide some insight
into how autobiographical modern New Yorker short
stories typically are.
The era selected for study is of interest because it
is contemporary and because there were two
different Executive Editors at the New Yorker
during this time, as well as two different sets of
Fiction Editors. In 1992, Tina Brown, the avant-
garde editor of Vanity Fair, became the third
Executive Editor of the New Yorker, shaking up its
somewhat stilted image and drawing renewed
attention to the periodical.1 At the time, the
New Yorker’s Fiction Department was under the
stewardship of the magazine’s Deputy Editor,
Charles McGrath, a well-respected editor and
writer who had been with the New Yorker since
the early 1970s.2 Two other senior Fiction Editors,
Roger Angell and Daniel Menaker, largely shared
McGrath’s responsibilities and were essentially his
equals in the Fiction Department’s hierarchy.
Both of these men had been members of the
New Yorker staff for over 20 years by 1992,3,4 and the
three were considered to have fairly traditional
tastes in fiction, in part due to the time they spent
at the New Yorker while it was under the steward-
ship of conservative Executive Editor William
Shawn. However, in early 1995, Bill Buford of the
unconventional British literary magazine Granta
was tapped to take over the New Yorker Fiction
Department, and during his reign, the Department
was controlled by one rather than multiple editors.5
Buford’s tenure continued beyond the end of the era
studied in this article and weathered the 1998
transition to a new, less risque´ Executive Editor,
when Pulitzer Prize winning author and New Yorker
staff writer David Remnick replaced Tina Brown.6
The period analyzed in this article allows the
significance of changes in both fiction and exe-
cutive editors to be assessed and ends just before
11 September 2001, in order to avoid dealing with
any alterations in New Yorker content that may have
been a result of the terrorist attacks.
The data set of New Yorker fiction referenced in
this article, which contains thirty-nine variables for
each of the 442 stories examined, was collected by
K.L. Milkman. The variables contained within this
data set are listed in Table 1, and an explanation
of the methodologies used in the compilation of
this database is available upon request. Not every
variable was available for every piece of fiction,

and missing variables were excluded from all
analyses conducted.
In Section 2 of this article, we present an over-
view of past work on similar topics. In Section 3, we
attempt to answer the question of whether or not
changes in Executive Editor or Fiction Editor are
associated with significant changes in the type of
fiction published in the New Yorker. In Section 4, we
examine whether or not New Yorker authors write
fiction about characters who share their demo-
graphic characteristics. In Section 5, a summary of
the main conclusions resulting from this article is
presented.
2 Literature Review
Although a great deal of quantitative literary analy-
sis has been conducted in the past, most notably by
Burrows (1987), Craig (2004), and Hoover (1998),
little if any analysis has been carried out using data
sets compiled by a human reader. The majority of
previous computational studies of literature have
been conducted on data sets collected by computer
programs, which are not sophisticated enough
to determine the demographic characteristics of
a protagonist, to classify secondary characters, or to
detect story topics, among other things. Instead,
past studies have focused on such subjects as
authorship attribution, word frequency, and trans-
lation. It is the hope of the authors of this article
that future computational studies of literature will
include work that relies on human readers to create
data sets containing attributes of fiction that are not
detectable using computer codes.7
3 Study 1: Editorial Shifts and
1990s New Yorker Fiction
Even for those who have worked at the New Yorker
for decades, it is difficult to understand or explain
the impact of editorial changes on the magazine’s
fictional content. However, it is possible to
analyze various components of New Yorker fiction
to determine if and how they changed concurrently
with the editorial power shifts that took place
during the 1990s. Here we examine differences
in a sample of 442 stories, 120 of which were
published under Charles McGrath,8 who served as
the New Yorker’s highest ranking Fiction Editor
between 5 October 1992 and 10 April 1995, and
322 of which were published under Bill Buford,
who served as Fiction Editor of the New Yorker
from 17 April 1995 through 17 September 2001.
We also examine differences in the same
sample of 442 stories published under successive
Executive Editors: 275 under Tina Brown, who
served as Executive Editor from 5 October 1992
until 3 August 1998, and 167 under David Remnick,
who took over as Executive Editor on 10 August
1998 and was still serving in that capacity on
17 September 2001.
In order to evaluate what changes in New Yorker
fiction were associated with different editorial
shifts that took place during the 1990s, we examine
the proportion of stories exhibiting various char-
acteristics before and after editorial shakeups at
the magazine. The discussion that follows presents
our significant findings and refers readers to tables

3.1 Results
A number of components of New Yorker fiction
changed significantly when there was a change in the
magazine’s Fiction Editor but remained unchanged
when there was a switch in the New Yorker’s
Executive Editor. We begin by discussing significant
shifts in the proportions of stories with certain
characteristics that accompanied Bill Buford’s rise to
the helm of the fiction department but were not
associated with a change in the New Yorker’s
Executive Editor. First, we find that the proportion
of stories published with third-person narrators (as
opposed to first-person narrators) increased sig-
nificantly under Bill Buford but was not statistically
different under Tina Brown and David Remnick
(Fig. 1 and Appendix Table 2). Similarly, there was
a significant increase in the percentage of fiction
published by male authors when Bill Buford took
over as Fiction Editor of the New Yorker, but the
proportion of fiction by men published in the
New Yorker was not significantly different under
successive Executive Editors (Fig. 2 and Appendix
Table 3). We also find that there was a significant
increase in the variance of the page length of
New Yorker fiction pieces published under Bill
Buford as compared with pieces published under
Charles McGrath, whereas there was no significant
change in the variance in the length of fiction
published under successive Executive Editors of the
magazine (Fig. 3 and Appendix Table 4).
The Fiction Editor transition we studied also
produced more shifts in the topics of New Yorker
fiction than a change in the magazine’s Executive
Editor. We examine the proportion of stories focus-
ing on each of twenty-eight topics (topics were
selected for analysis in advance of the data collec-
tion stage) under each editor in our sample.9 Bill10
Buford’s rise to control over the New Yorker’s
fiction department was accompanied by seven sig-
nificant shifts in the frequency of story topics, while
the change in Executive Editor we studied was only
accompanied by four significant shifts in the
frequency of story topics (Figs 4 and 5, Appendix
Tables 5 and 6).
In addition to examining significant shifts in the
proportion of stories with certain characteristics
that coincided with a change in the New Yorker’s
Fiction Editor, we examine shifts in the distribu-
tions of story characteristics. We find that the
distribution of story settings across the nine US
Census regions pictured in Fig. 6 shifted signifi-
cantly when there was a change in the New Yorker’s
Fiction Editor but remained relatively unaltered
under the different New Yorker Executive Editors in
our sample. In particular, the proportion of stories

set in the Middle Atlantic Region, which encom-
passes New York, increased dramatically when Bill
Buford took over for Charles McGrath in mid-1995,
but this statistic was not significantly affected by the
mid-1998 change in Executive Editor (Fig. 7 and
Appendix Table 7). The distribution of characters’
religions also shifted significantly in the fiction
published after Bill Buford replaced Charles
McGrath at the helm of the New Yorker’s Fiction
Department, but there was no significant difference
in the distribution of characters’ religions in the
fiction published under David Remnick and Tina
Brown. Specifically, McGrath published fiction with
a significantly higher percentage of Jewish characters
than Buford (Fig. 8 and Appendix Table 8). We also
find that the distributions of both protagonists’ ages
and characters’ ages differed significantly under
successive stewards of the Fiction Department in the
1990s but not under successive Executive Editors.
In particular, the proportion of protagonists and
characters in their twenties increased significantly
when Bill Buford replaced Charles McGrath, but
these proportions remained relatively stationary
when David Remnick replaced Tina Brown (Figs 9
and 10 and A1ppendix Table 9).
Four patterns in our data contradict the para-
digm that Fiction Editors exert more control than
Executive Editors over the fiction published at
the New Yorker. First, we find that statistically sig-
nificant shifts in the distributions of characters’
nationalities occurred when David Remnick replaced
Tina Brown, but there was not a significant shift in
these underlying distributions when Bill Buford took
over for Charles McGrath. However, the proportion

there were no shifts in these underlying distributions

3.2 Discussion
The statistical analyses presented in this section
indicate that changes in the Fiction Editor of the
New Yorker were associated with changes in various
aspects of the magazine’s fiction during the era
studied and that changes in the New Yorker’s
Executive Editor were associated with fewer
measurable changes in the fictional content of
the magazine. Overall, we find that under
Bill Buford:
 fewer stories were published with third-person
narrators
 more stories were published by male authors
 there was more variance in stories’ page length
 there were more stories about sex and fewer
about children, travel, drugs, money, religion,
and illness
 there was a shift in the geographic distribution
of story settings, and more fiction was set in the
Mid-Atlantic region

study can help clarify the influence of different
editors’ preferences on a magazine’s content,
which might not otherwise be recognized or
understood.
A significant question raised by the findings in
this section is why a change in the New Yorker’s
Fiction Editor would be associated with such
significant changes in the magazine’s fiction. There
are three plausible answers to this question: (1) the
submissions the New Yorker received changed as
a result of writers’ knowledge of who was making
selections at the magazine; (2) Charles McGrath
had significantly different tastes in fiction than Bill
Buford; and/or (3) our results are driven by general
trends in short fiction in the 1990s. It is impossible
to disentangle whether explanation (1) or (2) is
responsible for our findings with the data available
to us, but this could be a fruitful area for future
research if the New Yorker would provide data
about the characteristics of unpublished manu-
scripts submitted to its Fiction Department. We feel
some confidence in ruling out explanation (3) for
our results given that general trends in fiction would
have manifested themselves in the analyses we
conducted of the relationship between New Yorker
fiction and a change in the New Yorker’s Executive
Editor, and they did not.
The findings from this study suggest that the
New Yorker’s Executive Editors have less influence
over the magazine’s fiction content than the New
Yorker’s Fiction Editors. However, it seems likely
that these same Executive Editors have more
significant influence over some other aspect of the
New Yorker’s content. It would be interesting to
conduct a similar study of another magazine or
even another division of the New Yorker to see how
editorial changes at various levels impact other types
of magazine content. With respect to other literary
magazines, a greater focus on fiction vis-a-vis other
content might translate into greater shifts in fic-
tional content as a result of a change in Executive
Editor. It should also be acknowledged that the
influence of Brown and Remnick on the New
Yorker’s fiction arguably filtered through their
selections of fiction editors, and thus Brown’s
choice of Buford to replace McGrath could be
viewed as her most significant way of exerting
influence over the magazine’s fiction.
Unfortunately, the size of the data set examined
in this study was insufficient for addressing ques-
tions about the effects of a change in Fiction Editor
under a single Executive Editor or the effects of
a change in Executive Editor served by a single
Fiction Editor. However, it would be interesting in
a future study to see if Executive Editors perhaps
have a more significant impact on the New Yorker’s
fiction when their influence is not disturbed by
shifts in Fiction Editors. It would also be interesting
to see if a change in Fiction Editor might have
an even greater effect than detected in this study
if successive Fiction Editors were observed dur-
ing a time period when there was no change in
Executive Editor.
4 Study 2: How Demographically
Similar are the Authors of
New Yorker Fiction and the
Characters they Invent?
It has long been assumed that much of fiction
contains elements of autobiography. However, it is
difficult to imagine how one might quantify the
extent to which a piece of fiction is autobiograph-
ical in order to test this hypothesis. There are some
components of a work of fiction that can be
measured, however, which may offer some insight
into the question of how closely an author has
modeled her protagonist and secondary characters
on herself. These measurable components are
indicators of whether an author shares various
demographic characteristics with the protagonist

and secondary characters in a story. An examination
of the relationship between author and character
demographic characteristics at least begins to
address the question of whether fictional characters
are crafted, to some extent, in their authors’ own
image.
Using the sample of 442 New Yorker short
stories whose characteristics we documented for
this article, we examine the rate at which New Yorker
authors write about characters who share various
aspects of their demographic profile. In the discus-
sion that follows we present our significant findings
and refer readers to tables in the Appendix for
more detailed statistical evidence supporting each of
our results.
4.1 Results
We begin by discussing the demographic similarities
between New Yorker authors and their protagonists.
Consistent with the idea that authors write about
what they know, we find that the vast majority of
New Yorker fiction authors write stories about
protagonists of their gender (Fig. 16 and Appendix
Table 13). Interestingly, male and female authors do
this at differing levels—women write significantly
more often than men about protagonists of the
opposite gender. Similarly, we find that New Yorker
authors project their native nationalities on to
the protagonists they invent, the vast majority
of the time (Fig. 17 and Appendix Table 14) with
American authors writing about protagonists from
their country of origin at a significantly higher rate
than non-American authors.
In addition, we find that New Yorker authors
share their race with their protagonists signifi-
cantly more often than not, although again, authors
from different racial groups vary in the frequency
at which they write about protagonists who share
their race (Fig. 18 and Appendix Table 15). There
was only enough data to statistically examine the
strength of the relationship between Caucasian
authors and the protagonists in their stories,

and that relationship was extremely strong, with
nearly all of the protagonists in stories written by
Caucasian authors sharing their author’s race.
However, the other data collected indicates that
there is also a strong relationship between the race
of Black, Asian, and Hispanic authors and their
protagonists. Finally, we find that the vast majority
of New Yorker authors write about protagonists
who are within or below their decade age range,
or in other words, most protagonists are in an age
group that their author has experienced (Fig. 19
and Appendix Table 16).12 Slightly more than a fifth
of protagonists in the fiction studied were within
the precise decade age-range of the author of the
story in which they appeared.
Next we turn to an examination of the demo-
graphic similarities between New Yorker authors
and their secondary characters. We find that New
Yorker authors are slightly less likely to write about
secondary characters of their gender than of the
opposite gender (Fig. 20 and Appendix Table 17).
At first glance, this seems at odds with our finding
that New Yorker authors write about protagonists
who share their gender the vast majority of the
time. However, this pattern seems likely due to
New Yorker authors’ heavy reliance on hetero-
sexual romantic plot lines,13 which require the
creation of characters of the opposite gender from
protagonists.
We find that New Yorker authors share their
nationality with the secondary characters in their
stories significantly more often then not (Fig. 21
and Appendix Table 18). Again, this tendency is
stronger among American authors who publish in
the New Yorker than among authors of other
nationalities. We also find that New Yorker
authors project their race onto their secondary
characters the vast majority of the time (Fig. 22 and

Appendix Table 19). Although very few stories in
our sample were written by minorities, our data
allows us to detect statistically significant differences
in the rates at which both Caucasian authors and
Black authors write about secondary characters of
their race, and the limited data on Hispanic and
Asian authors suggests that this pattern applies to
them as well. Finally, we observe that the secondary
characters in New Yorker fiction are almost always
in or below the same age range as the authors
of the stories in which they appear (Fig. 23 and
Appendix Table 20). All of the demographic

frequencies than the similarities between authors
and their protagonists, suggesting that authors
may be more prone to create protagonists in their
own image than secondary characters.
As mentioned earlier, with the exception of
Caucasian authors, there was insufficient data to
draw statistically supportable conclusions about
the relationship between the race of New Yorker
authors and their protagonists, and only for
Caucasian and Black authors was it possible to
draw such conclusions about the relationship
between the race of authors and their secondary
characters. Consequently, the two sets of data
on protagonists and secondary characters were
combined for analysis under the broader heading
of ‘characters’. This aggregated data allows us to
conclude that Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, and Asian
authors all write about characters who share their
race significantly more often than not (Fig. 24
and Appendix Table 21). The rates at which Blacks
and Hispanic portray characters of their own race
are extremely similar, yet considerably lower than
those of Asian and Caucasian authors, who also
appear to write about members of their own races
at comparable frequencies.
Finally, we turn to an analysis of the settings
selected for the stories in this study. We find that
New Yorker authors not only write about characters
with numerous similarities to themselves; they
also write about settings that are familiar to them.
Authors in our data set locate stories in their
native world region significantly more often than
not (Fig. 25 and Appendix Table 22),14 and
American authors write stories set in their home
region of the world significantly more often than
non-American authors.

hypothesis that New Yorker fiction authors write
more often than not about protagonists who share
many of their demographic characteristics. The
results also suggest that secondary characters have
many demographic similarities to the authors of the
stories in which they appear, albeit fewer than
protagonists. It is not surprising that New Yorker
authors of fiction write about what they know.
However, to our knowledge, the commonly held
hypothesis that authors of fiction write about
characters who are similar to them has never been
tested, making our study the first to provide a sound
evidentiary basis for a widely held notion about
fiction.
Our results indicate that New Yorker authors
have a strong propensity to write about protagonists
who share their gender, race, and nationality,
and who are in or below their age range. Similarly,
they write more often than not about secondary
characters who share their race, their nationality,
and are within or below their age range. Our results
also suggest that New Yorker authors set their
stories in locales where they have lived significantly
more often than not. Perhaps more interesting
than any of these observations, however, is our
finding that New Yorker authors whose demo-
graphic characteristics make them minorities as
far as the magazine’s publishing roster is concerned
(i.e. females, non-Whites, and non-Americans)
are less likely than others to write about protago-
nists and secondary characters who share their
demographic characteristics. Given the data avail-
able to us, it is not possible to determine if this is
due to a selection bias at the New Yorker, the choices
made by authors about what fiction to submit to the
New Yorker, or general tendencies among minority
authors to conform to fictional norms. It would be
interesting if a future study were able to disentangle
these alternative explanations for our results.
In addition to this potentially fruitful area for
future research, our findings suggest a number of
additional topics for future study. It seems that
further analysis of the relationship between the race,
sexuality, and religion of authors and their char-
acters could yield interesting results. It might also
be worthwhile to look at the same aspects of fiction
studied in this article within the context of novels
and other sets of short fiction besides the stories
published by the New Yorker in the 1990s in order to
understand whether or not the conclusions drawn
in this article apply to fictional literature as a whole,
short fiction as a whole, or some other, narrower
literary grouping.
5 Conclusions
In this article, an extensive quantitative analysis
of two questions with regard to the 442 pieces
of fiction published between 5 October 1992 and
17 September 2001 in the New Yorker magazine
yielded several interesting results. The analysis
presented in Section 3 examined shifts in the New
Yorker’s fictional content that were associated with
a change in the magazine’s Fiction Editor as well as
shifts associated with a change in the magazine’s

Executive Editor. We find that a change in the
New Yorker’s Fiction Editor is associated with
numerous significant shifts in the magazine’s fic-
tional content. Specifically, we find that a change
in the New Yorker’s Fiction Editor is associated
with shifts in such variables as narrative voice, the
regional distribution of stories set in the US, the
gender of authors, the distribution of characters’
religions, the variance in stories’ lengths, the age
distributions of protagonists and characters as a
whole, the frequency of seven story topics, and the
proportion of British characters in New Yorker
short stories. Quantitative analyses reported on in
Section 3 also led to the conclusion that the
changes in New Yorker fiction associated with Bill
Buford’s replacement of Charles McGrath as the
New Yorker’s Fiction Editor were more pronounced
than the changes associated with David Remnick’s
replacement of Tina Brown as the magazine’s
Executive Editor. The shift in Executive Editor
studied in this article was only accompanied by
changes in the distribution of characters’ countries
of origin, authors’ and characters’ racial distribu-
tions, characters’ sexuality, and four shifts in topic
frequency.
As reported in Section 4 of this article,
quantitative analysis demonstrated that, in the vast
majority of cases, authors of New Yorker fiction
write about protagonists who share their race,
gender, and nationality and who are within or
below their age range. These findings are consistent
with the widely held notion that much of fiction
is autobiographical. We also find that, to a slightly
lesser degree, New Yorker authors invent secondary
characters who share their race and nationality
and who are within or below their age range.
However, most likely in deference to heterosexual
plot considerations, authors write about secondary
characters who, slightly more than half the time,
do not share their gender. This finding suggests
that New Yorker secondary characters are crafted
to resemble members of the demographic group
that authors are most familiar with, but that
secondary characters are less likely than protagonists
to be autobiographical representations of an author.
Finally, we conclude that the majority of the
time New Yorker authors write stories set in their
home region(s). All of these findings point to the
conclusion that the quantifiable components of
short stories in the New Yorker are largely based
on what an author knows and that characters are,
to a great extent, demographically similar to the
authors who invent them.
In addition to presenting specific findings, this
article demonstrates several ways in which statistical
analysis can successfully be employed to address
questions about literature. Although quantitative
methods have been used before to examine trends
in literature, the traditional approach has been to
examine questions that do not require content
analysis by a human reader. This article uses
variables derived both from reading stories and
from outside sources to draw conclusions about
literature. It is the hope of the authors that future
research will further examine the questions raised
in this article by looking at other types of literature
and asking an aneven broader range of questions
about the impact of editors on fiction and the
similarities between authors and the characters they
invent. However, care should always be taken in
such studies to select a data set with objective
variables in order to avoid the danger of computing
statistics influenced by the interpretation of a
human reader.

7 It should be noted that whenever data are collected by
a human reader for a study, an element of subjectivity
is introduced. This is the danger of relying upon
people to create data sets about fiction rather than
computers. However, it is the belief of the authors of
this article that if the set of variables being cataloged
are defined carefully enough to be largely objective
and if the data set collected is large enough, this
danger can be limited sufficiently to cause little
if any variation in results from one experimenter
to the next.
8 Although Roger Angell and Daniel Menaker exerted
significant control over the New Yorker’s Fiction
Department during the early 1990s, from this
point on Charles McGrath will be referred to as
the Fiction Editor who preceded Bill Buford because
McGrath held the highest title of the three.
9 It should be noted that many of the twenty-eight
topics coded as present or absent from a story are
highly correlated (e.g., marriage and family).

11 This surprising decrease in the number of British
characters in New Yorker fiction printed under
Buford—a native of England—may be explained by
the Editor’s jaded attitude towards traditional British
writing. [Bill Buford, Telephone interview with
K.L Milkman (18 March 2004)].
12 The average age of the New Yorker authors in this
sample was 49.8 years. Thus, the fact that authors were
found to write the vast majority of the time about
protagonists in or, to an even greater degree, below
their age range could be a coincidence based on the
fact that the majority of characters, like the majority of
Americans (73% according 2000 Census figures), were
under the age 50 as of 2000.
13 Around 96% of the characters in New Yorker fiction
during the era examined were heterosexuals.
