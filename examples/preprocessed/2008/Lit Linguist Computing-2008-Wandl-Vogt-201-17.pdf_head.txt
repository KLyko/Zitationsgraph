Abstract
The DATABASE OF ELECTRONIC TEXTS of the LEXICON OF BAVARIAN
DIALECTS IN AUSTRIA (WBO¨) (TEXTKORPUS zum WBO¨)—The Lexicon of
Bavarian Dialects in Austria (Wo¨rterbuch der bairischen Mundarten in
O¨sterrreich [WBO¨]) is based on a collection of about 4 million single records.
They represent the variety of the regional, social and historical Bavarian dialects.
About 10% of all entries are excerpts from texts of various types. The
lexicographer has to draw the illustrative quotations from the original texts.
The digitized full-texts have been dated and localized, thus each quotation can be
placed in time and area enabling the lexicogapher to choose a representative
number of examples. For the definitions, the most appropriate and illustrative
quotations have to be found, in order to actively support the lexicographer´s
work, the Institute of Lexicography of Austrian Dialects and Names / Institut fu¨r
O¨sterreichische Dialekt- und Namenlexika (http://www.oeaw.ac.at/dinamlex)
started a new project: the so-called DBO¨ (Database of the Bavarian Dialects in
Austria / Datenbank der bairischen Mundarten in O¨sterreich), financed by the
O¨sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften / Austrian Academy of Sciences.
One main database includes the so-called Hauptkatalog, the main archive; there
are additional databases which are necessary to retrieve correct information
about the questionnaire, the localization of the word and the date of its
recording. One component of the DBO¨ is the database of electronic texts of the
WBO¨, including some 90 Austrian texts spanning several centuries, representing
the Austrian dialects. The original texts are scanned using the Austrian OCR-
programme proLector V1.20 (A.1) which allows the training of various fonts. The
machine-readable texts are converted in TUSTEP (Tu¨binger System von
Textverarbeitungs-Programmen / Tu¨bingen System of Text Processing Pro-
grammes). The TUSTEP-files get an alphanumeric key, which allows one to

retrieve each quotation from the database in a chronological order and to sort it
according to its localization. Finally the texts are broken down into the requisite
sized pieces for quoting in the WBO¨-entries. Using a special programme the
quotations can easily be reconnected and replaced in the proper context from
which they were drawn. The digital texts are a valuable source for the
lexicographer freeing him from the monotony of checking over and over again,
thus leaving him more time for his proper work, namely the writing of entries for
the WBO¨. Furthermore, the digital texts are important for speeding up the
dictionary’s publication in accordance with the guidelines of the Straffungskon-
zept 1993 and 1998.
