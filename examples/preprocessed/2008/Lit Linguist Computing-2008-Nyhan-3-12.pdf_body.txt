Patrick S. Dinneen published a variety of Irish
language materials during his career including plays,
essays, collection of poetry, biographies, and
scholarly editions of texts. However, it is his
lexicographical work that he is most celebrated
for, and his first Irish-English dictionary was
published in 1904. When the plates of that
dictionary were—luckily for us as one scholar has
indicated (Ua Su´illeabha´in, 2005, p. 71)—destroyed
during the 1916 Easter rising, Dinneen began work
on a new and enlarged edition that culminated
in the publication of Foclo´ir Gaedhilge agus Be´arla
(Irish-English Dictionary) in 1927.
Dinneen’s Foclo´ir Gaedhilge agus Be´arla (here-
after FGB) is one of the richest works available for
modern Irish, and is also useful for some aspects of
medieval Irish. Though editors of later dictionaries
could call on better resources than those at
Dinneen’s disposal, FGB presents a ‘fuller coverage
of the modern Irish lexicon’ (O´ Murchu´, 2005,
p. 100) than O´ Do´naill’s dictionary, which
succeeded Dinneen in 1977. Further, in some
instances, Dinneen presents a more complete treat-
ment of words than is to be found in O´ Do´naill
(O´ Murchu´, 2005).
In addition to its acknowledged scholarly value,
FGB is held in esteem by many for reasons as
diverse as the sense of Dinneen’s passion for the

Irish language that exudes from its pages; the fact
that it preserves important citations from the Irish
song tradition (O´ Madaga´in, 2005); the dictionary’s
sometimes unintentionally humorous citations or
definitions, for example, caithim gamhain ‘I give
birth to a still-born calf’ (O´ Murchu´, 2005, p. 82);
as well as the occasional digressions it contains,
described by O’Connell as seducing ‘the reader into
many fascinating byways’ (O’Connell, 1984). In
short, though almost a 100-years old, Dinneen’s
dictionary remains an invaluable resource for
scholars, writers, teachers, linguists, historians,
and all others who speak and learn the Irish
language.
Despite the popularity of Dinneen’s dictionary,
many non-specialists find that aspects of its
presentation and orthography form a barrier to
efficient use of it. The font of the dictionary is Clo´
Gaelach (see Example 1 in Fig. 1), a font that many
modern Irish speakers are unfamiliar with, and
find difficult to read. The orthography of the
dictionary pre-dates the spelling reform of 1946,
and because many present day speakers of modern
Irish are unfamiliar with such orthography, locating
the required lexical entry can be somewhat of a hit
and miss process. It was recognized that a digital
edition of the dictionary would enable new solu-
tions to these problems to be developed, and that
the potential value of a fully searchable edition
of FGB to the research communities of Irish
studies and Humanities Computing is high.
Therefore, the Corpus of Electronic Texts (hereafter
CELT) applied to the Irish Research Council for
the Humanities and Social Sciences for funding to
design an integrated electronic edition of Dinneen’s
dictionary and was successful. In order to
explain the concept of an integrated edition, and
the type of integration that is envisaged for the
digital edition of FGB, the CELT project,
the electronic Dictionary of the Irish language
project, the electronic Lexicon and the Linking
Dictionaries and Text collaboration will now
be described.
2 Role of Dinneen in Irish
Language Humanities Computing
2.1 Corpus of electronic texts
The CELT project at the History Department,
University College Cork, is a scholarly corpus of
multi-lingual texts of Irish literature and history.
The texts in the CELT corpus are written in Irish of
all periods, Latin, English, French, and both English
and English translations of original texts are
represented. It is the largest Irish text corpus of
its kind available freely to members of the
public. CELT is conformant with the TEI guidelines,
encoded in SGML and will soon switch to XML as
the meta-markup language of choice for its master
files. As of September 2006, the corpus has 9.3
million words available online. My doctoral
research, carried out at CELT, examined the
application of XML to the historical lexicography
of Old, Middle, and Early modern Irish (Nyhan,
2006b). Part of that work focused on the creation
of an electronic Lexicon of Irish covering the
period c.700–1700.
2.2 Electronic Lexicon of old Irish
The Lexicon forms a re-edited subset of the Royal
Irish Academy’s Dictionary of the Irish language
(Marstrander et al., Compact edition, 1998) and is
supplemented with other sources and the findings of
recent scholarship. Six letters of the Lexicon have
been completed to date. The Dictionary of the Irish
language (hereafter DIL) is a scholarly historical
dictionary of Old, Middle, and Early modern
Irish, and though it is widely accepted as the most
authoritative reference work of its kind available
for the Irish language, it exhibits serious limitations
in the structure and presentation of its data.1

These limitations are compounded by aspects of the
Irish language, which experienced complex sound
changes at various stages of its development, and
the language therefore displays a complicated
orthography (Beekes, 1995; Thurneysen, 1998).
Words beginning with air-, for example, can
appear as aur-, er-, ir-, and ur-. Thus, the word
airthach, is also attested as aurthach, urthach,
and erthach. A student who encounters the forms
urthach and erthach in a text is unlikely to be aware
of such spelling variants—especially in light of the
fact that a table explaining such sound changes is
not provided in DIL—and so is wholly dependent
upon cross-references to find the word in question.
In the case of the word airthach, however, no cross-
reference is provided to the forms erthach, aurthach,
or urthach. The only form that is cross-referenced
is urrach. Thus, students and even scholars of
medieval Irish frequently spend a large amount of
time locating a required word, and many fail to find
the object of their search altogether.
In order to resolve these limitations, among
others, the electronic Lexicon was designed.
The Lexicon contains the essential data, encountered
by the scholar in the first instance, deeply encoded
in XML. The many inconsistencies in DIL including,
inter alia, its inconsistent use of abbreviations
and citations, proliferation of lexical entries that
lack a repeatable structure, and lack of cross
references to variant forms have been remedied in
the Lexicon, which offers advanced search and
interrogation possibilities. The excerpt below
(Example 2) from the possessive pronoun mo
indicates the treatment of material in it.
The Lexicon will be published incrementally on
http://www.epu.ucc.ie/lexicon during 2007.
2.3 The eDIL project and the LDT
The Centre for Irish and Celtic Studies at the
University of Ulster, with funding from the Arts and
Humanities Research Board, is currently preparing a
digital edition of the entire DIL (Fomin and Toner,
2006). The eDIL is due for completion in 2007. The
CELT project at University College Cork and the
eDIL team at the University of Ulster have been
collaborating since 2003 in the Higher Education
Authority funded Linking Dictionaries and Texts
(hereafter LDT) project. Upon commencement of
that project, many of the texts cited in both the
Lexicon and eDIL were available in the best research
libraries only, and scholars frequently invested
considerable time and money travelling to research
libraries to access these texts. The LDT project,
which also reaches completion in 2007, identified
the most commonly cited texts in DIL, prepared
TEI-encoded electronic editions of them and
generated links from citations in eDIL to the
corresponding electronic text editions in the CELT
corpus.
2.4 The Digital Dinneen project
When completed in 2009, the Digital Dinneen will
extend CELT’s lexicographical material from the
Old Irish period (c.700–900 AD) up to modern
literary Irish. The aim of the Digital Dinneen project
is not only to develop an electronic edition of
FGB, but to publish it as an integrated edition
that contains both fixed links to the CELT project,
the Lexicon, and eDIL, and also arbitrary,

user-generated links from the corpus to the
Digital Dinneen and vice versa. Creating such an
edition can be described as having two broad stages
of research: the first is the creation of a stable,
interoperable, and extensible electronic edition that
meets the highest scholarly standards. The second is
the further development and transformation of the
markup contained in that edition, as well as its
supplementation with further technologies, such as
Javascript, to support the development of the kind
of integration with centralized and de-centralized
text collections that is envisaged. These two stages
will now be used as a framework to discuss the
development of the edition further.
3 Methodology and Scope
of the Dinneen Project
3.1 Desiderata of the digital edition
Important aims of the digital edition include
resolving the problems of orthography and font
that many present day Irish speakers encounter in
FGB. It is intended to offer users of the electronic
edition the choice of rendering the data with one
of two stylesheets: one will present the data in
Roman font and the other in Clo´ Gaelach font.
Using De Bhaldraithe’s Inne´acs Nua-Ghaeilge don
Dictionary of the Irish language (1981), as well
as additional information supplied by Dr Sea´n Ua
Su´illeabha´in, Irish department, University College
Cork, pointers will be generated from headwords
in the Digital Dinneen (to the unique ids on
headwords in eDIL and the Lexicon) to allow a
user to follow a modern Irish form in Dinneen’s
dictionary back to its earlier forms in eDIL and the
Lexicon. Further, the feasibility of incorporating the
post-spelling reform orthography of headwords, as
meta-text of the headwords in the Digital Dinneen,
is currently being research to see if such an
undertaking will be possible in the three year time
span of the project. In regard to the markup of the
data contained in the dictionary, all information is
being encoded including but not limited to: forms,
senses, etymologies, parts of speech, registers,
sources, grammatical information, personal names,
and places names. Markup of the information
contained in the dictionary is drawing to comple-
tion, and it has already been possible to use the
electronic edition to support a range of applied
research. For example, a word list supplied to
Dinneen by the poet Riobard Bheldon, that has
since disappeared, was reassembled based on
information extracted from the dictionary (Nyhan,
2006a).
3.2 Data capture
The data capture was outsourced to Godrej Global
Solutions Ltd, who returned the data with basic
structural and presentational markup, and an
accuracy level in excess of 99.995%.
3.3 XML markup
During work on the Lexicon, the data were encoded
in middle of the road XML, defined in a transitional
DTD, and TEI conformance was also achieved at
a later stage through XSLT post-processing. This
approach is also being applied to the encoding of
the Digital Dinneen. The main benefit of such an
approach is that when working to understand,
interpret, and describe complex data, complete
focus can be given to designing markup that
accurately describes that data. Considerations
about how the data model in question relates to
the TEI guidelines can then be dealt with at a later
stage in the project, when the understanding of the
type and structure of data in the dictionary is better
developed.
3.4 XSLT transformations
In marked contrast with the Royal Irish Academy’s
Dictionary of the Irish language, Dinneen’s diction-
ary can be described as being reasonably consistent
in its structure, layout, use of abbreviations,
bibliographical citations, and presentation of data.
Earlier research into using XSLT to automate XML
tagging of Irish lexicographical material highlighted
that consistency of structure in the base text is an
important factor for raising the accuracy rate of
transformations. So, with this strong foundation
in place, a series of XSLT transformations were
developed based on a combination of matching
patterns in the text and also upon testing the

content of elements and proceeding in specified
ways once a match was found.
As indicated earlier, the captured text was
returned with basic XML structural and present-
ational markup that preserved the formatting of
the original hard-copy edition. As illustrated in
Example 3, this markup included an <entry>
element that contains and delineates each lexical
entry; a <head> element encoding each headword;
an <emph> element to encode text in italics; and a
<d> element encoding pieces of Irish language text.
The file was processed using a Sed script, and the
linux utilities sort and uniq, to get an alphabetical
list of the content of <emph> elements, accom-
panied by a number indicating the number of times
each text string re-occurred.
Interestingly, some of the problems of con-
sistency, from the perspective of XSLT transforma-
tions, were introduced into the text at the data
capture stage, and were highlighted by this routine.
When the dictionary was being captured, and
presentational (rather than descriptive) markup
was being applied, strings of grammatical informa-
tion, for example, were rightly encoded (based on the
type of markup that was being applied) in one
<emph> element that spanned the length of the
italicized grammatical information. However, this
presentational markup is not retained in the electro-
nic edition, but rather transformed into descriptive
markup. To increase the success rate of the XSLT
generation of elements, necessary aspects of pre-
processing such as this were identified, and, for
example, a tokenising template was applied to all
<emph> elements to separate its contents based on
punctuation.
After the pre-processing stage was completed, a
series of XSLT transformation were written, based
on the results that had been obtained from the
analysis of the content of <emph>. If the content of
the element matched a specified string in the XSLT
file, the element was transformed accordingly,
otherwise <emph> was encoded as bibliographical
information. This proved a very convenient way to
assess the accuracy of the scripts across the entire
dictionary, because at the test stage, it was possible
to extract the content of all bibliographical ele-
ments, thus easily identifying information that was
being encoded incorrectly. All the markup of
grammatical information, place name information,
and bibliographical citations was accurately auto-
mated in this routine. The next XSLT transforma-
tion was based on observable patterns in the text,
for example, if the string preceding <emph> was
Lat. or Fr., then <emph> was transformed to
<frn lang¼"la"> or whatever.
In the case of <d> elements (marking Irish
language text), it was observed that inflected forms
are usually listed after the head word and that the
root of the word is usually indicated by a dash.
Therefore, the contents of <d> elements were tested
for an initial dash, if it were present, <d> was
transformed to a <form>, otherwise it was trans-
formed to a citation.
Then, building on the results of these transfor-
mations, another set of scripts was written
<entry><head><d>3 A,</d></head> <emph type="italic">interj., aspir.</emph>, precedes voc. 
case, <emph type="italic">sing.</emph> and <emph type="italic">pl.</emph>, often slurred over 
in pronunciation; silent before vowel or <d>fh</d> and somet. not written, being replaced by an
apostrophe or simply omitted; <emph type="italic">smt.</emph> Eng. O, though not an equivalent, 
represents it; <d>a fhir an fháinne,</d> O man of the ring; <d>a Phádraig,</d> O Patrick;
<d>éistidh, a dhaoine,</d> listen, O people; <d>a mhic,</d> my son; the usage, <d>a mh' 
anam,</d> my soul! is exceptional.</entry>
Example 3 Capture text
<xsl:template match="text() 
[name(preceding-sibling::*[1])='cit'] 
[name(following-sibling::*[1])='cit']">
<def> 
<xsl:value-of select="."/>

to generate markup of further portions of the
dictionary, such as definition text.
The automation of tagging with XSLT proved
to be very successful. As already indicated, all
the markup of grammatical information, place
names, bibliographical citations, foreign languages,
citations, translations, and senses was successfully
generated. The automation of forms of the head-
word was not as successful because it was based only
on the criterion that the form begins with a dash,
but this transformation will be further refined.
3.5 TEI modifications
As has already been stated, conformance with the
TEI guidelines will be achieve through XSLT
post-processing, but it is nevertheless clear, at this
stage of research, that some modifications and exten-
sions of the TEI Set for Print Dictionaries (Sperberg-
McQueen and Bernard, 2002) will be required.
It is frequently observed by meta-lexicographers
when discussing the development of dictionaries
from a historical perspective, that many dictionaries
cannibalize the ones that went before them. So too,
it seems, is the case with markup of dictionaries.
The Digital Dinneen project will incorporate some
TEI modifications proposed by the eDIL team,
including the element <egForm>, devised to allow
the grouping of ‘sections of related grammatical
information associated with any morphological
item’ (Fomin and Toner, 2006, p. 87) and the tag
<modifier> to markup ‘different linguistic items
that modify the meaning of the headword, such as
prepositions, prefixes, and particles’ (Fomin and
Toner, 2006, p. 86). Modifications of the TEI made
by the electronic Scottish National Dictionary project
will also be availed of, including the attributes made
available on the <cit> element and on the <geo>
element to allow identification of oral and print
sources (Rennie, 2001, pp. 156–57).
The Digital Dinneen project will add a new
element to the TEI DTD called <mut>, to allow
initial mutations that occur in Irish such as
nasalization, gemination, and lenition to be
encoded. For example, the possessive pronoun mo
can lenite some nouns noun that follow it, and the
value of the attribute type available on <mut> will
be permitted to be one of n/g/l to specify the type of
mutation in question (See Example 7).
Further, Dinneen frequently gives detailed infor-
mation about how a headword combines with other
words in a sentence. The merits of creating a new
element called <syntax> to encode this information
are being researched. While it would be possible to
encode this information in a generic note modified
<entry><head><d>Annáil,</d></head> <d>-ála,</d> <emph type="italic">pl. id.</emph>, 
<d>-álaigh,</d> and <d>-álacha,</d> <emph type="italic">f.</emph>, year, age,

with an attribute, working on the basis of core
context and the expectation that researchers will
want to manipulate this information further, it
seems likely that this element will also be added to
the TEI DTD at post-processing stage. A simplified
example is given in Example 8.
4 Integration and Role of
Digital Dinneen
The type of integration envisaged for the Digital
Dinneen includes both links that are hard coded into
the edition itself, and also the extension of
mechanisms that are being developed to support
arbitrary, user generated data queries.
4.1 Extending LDT to Dinneen
As indicated earlier, the LDT project was an Irish
cross-border collaboration between University
College Cork and the University of Ulster,
Coleraine. It was based on the observation that the
effectiveness of CELT, the Lexicon and eDIL as
research tools could be maximised through cooper-
ation. It was envisaged that this cooperation would
take the form of conventional predetermined (fixed)
links, either encoded in a static HTML file or using
HTML generated from an SGML or XML source.
This would enable users to click on a bibliographical
citation (in eDIL or the Lexicon) that would resolve
to the specified text in the CELT website.
The technology that facilitates this is common-
place and well established on the Internet and
involves the citational information being appended
to the URI in the conventional manner, as illus-
trated in Example 9.
After the citational information has been
appended to the URI, a server side application
uses a table of the known bibliographical data
(based on the document abbreviation and the
format of the bibliographical numeration) to
determine whether the required document is
on-line or not. If it is, the server will return the
document fragment surrounding the reference; if
not, it will return an explanation. In this way, as
documents are added to the CELT text-base over the
coming years, further references from eDIL and the
Lexicon will be satisfied, because the citation data
required for recognition can be stored in the TEI
header of the CELT documents themselves, and
extracted for use by the server on an automated
basis.
While the technology that facilitates the type
of fixed linking described here is easy to
implement, devising a system to automate the
XML encoding of bibliographical references proved
much more complex. This was achieved with a
90% accuracy level with regular expressions applied
in a Sed script.
The mechanism described here will also be
extended to the Digital Dinneen and will be a
boon for scholars of modern Irish. Because many
of the texts available at CELT date from the Old
and Middle Irish periods, the corpus is currently
being supplement with further editions of modern
Irish texts.
4.2 Linking corpus to Lexicon and
the Digital Dinneen
During research on the Lexicon, a mechanism to
enable arbitrary, user generated links between
centralized and de-centralized text corpora
and XML encoded lexicographical resources was
developed. In order to ensure that the impact of the
<syntax>An is often used in close combination with prep[ositions], especially 
those ending with a vowel, as do ‘n  or don, i san, 'san or san, i sna or 's na, 
ó'n  or ón, gus an, leis an, do na or dos na, in which the old initial s of the art[icle] is 
preserved </syntax> 
Example 8 Syntax elemant
<cit><bibl>ZCP</bibl> <biblscope>xiii 169.36 </biblscope></cit>, 
the link would be in the format 
<xptr to="http://celt.ucc.ie/cgi-bin/lookup? cite=ZCP\%40xiii\%40169.36"/>

technicalities of such a system can be kept to a
minimum for the end user, and to enable ease of
use, it was decided that it should be possible to
highlight any word or phrase in the CELT corpus
and retrieve it in the Lexicon. The nature of Internet
development over the past decade encourages this
approach, although there are misgivings in related
fields such as Library Science about the levels of
software and skills needed for anything more
than occasional use of real-time referencing
(Janes, 2002).
A robust mechanism for arbitrary reference
that could be adapted to enable textual
connections between CELT and the Lexicon, or
indeed vice versa, was kindly brought to my
attention by a colleague.2 The piece of Javascript
illustrated in Example 10 is the work of authors or
contributors of blogging systems like Wordpress3
and others, where it was designed for the capture
of URIs.
Suitably adapted, the code must be entered all
on one line (it is broken over several lines in
Example 10 for convenience) and installed in
browsers that support bookmarklets. The code
initiates a DOM function getSelection() that
captures the highlighted area to a variable Q, and
a window is then opened to a suitable URI, with the
escaped value of Q appended as a value to the field
text. Once installed, the user can highlight a word
in the CELT corpus in the browser, and click on
the new bookmarklet. The text gets sent to the
URI specified, which in this implementation is
the development lookup function for the
Lexicon. Finally, the XSLT stylesheet that has been
developed generates the lookup display.
An example of a user having highlighted a
word in the saga Fingal Rona´in and clicked on
the lookup button is illustrated in Fig. 2
(Example 11).
This mechanism will also be extended to the
Digital Dinneen to allow users to highlight words
in modern Irish texts, click on a toolbar button, and
retrieve the required entry from the Digital Dinneen.
In addition to enabling students, scholars, and
lay readers to use existing resources such as CELT,
the Lexicon, eDIL, and Digital Dinneen more
effectively, this method of arbitrary textual
linking enables existing scholarly resources to be
examined from different perspectives. For example,
words highlighted in the CELT corpus that are
not retrieved in the Lexicon, eDIL, or Digtial
Dinneen will most likely represent words, that
for one reason or another, were not included in
these dictionaries, whether as head-words or
variants, thus providing information for future
supplements to all of the lexicographical materials
described here.
5 Future Plans
It is hoped that further funding will be secured
to allow research on the Lexicon and on the
research infrastructure described here to continue.
While many research questions have been
answered, some still remain. For example, the
question of how to refine the arbitrary linking
mechanism between Corpus and lexicographical
resource so that the correct homograph is
returned still remains unanswered. It is hoped that
research into text mining may provide some
solutions. It is also hoped that funding will
be secured to develop electronic teaching and
learning applications for use in conjunction
with the resources described here, and, indeed, in
conjunction with other similar minority language
humanities computing projects.
