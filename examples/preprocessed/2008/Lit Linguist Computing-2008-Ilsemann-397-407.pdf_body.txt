
In 2005 the Shakespeare Jahrbuch (Ilsemann, 2005)
published the results of my investigations into the
question of what the frequency distribution of
speech lengths can contribute to the analysis of lit-
erature (Fig. 1). The main argument was that
Shakespeare’s work can be divided into plays that
were written before 1599 for various stages, and
plays that came into existence since 1599 and were
mainly produced for the Globe Theatre.
The most obvious change was the shift in the
speech lengths that were most often used from nine
words to four words, and as the stage size was iden-
tical to The Theatre (built in 1576) the assumption
arose that there was a higher degree of artistic
involvement in the production of plays, once Shake-
speare had become co-owner of the Globe in 1599.
The shift was seen as decisive in the wider con-
text of the relationship between rhetorical speeches
and dramatic actions. The suggestion was that
rhetoric and declamations receded and were
replaced by refined acting using the spatial dimen-
sions of the stage and speeding up events by shorter
speeches. This was also regarded as part of the grow-
ing maturity of Shakespeare. In the face of a general
shift towards shorter speeches, soliloquies and
monologues gained new qualities. Whereas before
they had to be seen within the framework of rhetori-
cal devices that kept actors rambling and lamenting,
they now appeared as functional components of
plays, adding also to the aesthetic values of varietas
and copia—or variety and abundance.
The shift in speech lengths was also considered to
be an unbiased demonstration that Shakespeare was
the real author of his plays. This would not exclude
collaborations with other authors, but the artistic
involvement is so clearly marked by the opening of
the Globe in 1599 that only Shakespeare’s biographi-
cal dates best match the statistical data of his works.
By coincidence somebody else looked into the
same question during the preparations for the

article in 2003 and 2004 though from a quite differ-
ent vantage point. In 2005, James Shapiro published
his much praised biography 1599: A Year in the Life
of William Shakespeare (Shapiro, 2005). In the book,
Shapiro traces both what Shakespeare achieved and
what Elizabethans experienced that year and he
attaches particular importance to the development
of Shakespeare as a writer. Whereas before
Shakespeare had often been lifted out of time and
place Shapiro undertook the difficult task to do
some imaginative writing with deep insights into
the situation of the playwright and poet at a time
of private and public changes.
Another factor in the decision to carry on with
speech lengths analyses was the installation of the
new drama analysis program IDAP that is available
via internet from http://idap.engsem.uni-hann
over.de
The program provides the material for the speech
length distribution of all Shakespeare plays and its
graphics charts allow for comparisons of reliable data
that have not been possible before.1 Particularly
when absolute figures have been converted to per-
centage representations it becomes possible to see
developments and similarities between plays. The
task that offers itself is twofold and can be summed
up in the following two provisional questions:
(1) Does the established order of when the plays
came into existence come out in speech length
distribution curves?
(2) Are there similarities in the speech length
distributions that appertain to a particular
genre?
Another complication must certainly be seen in
the fact that many of the plays produced before
1599 were collaborations. Kermode recalls the
early dramatic work of Shakespeare in particular
(Kermode, 2000) and takes up suggestions
from William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion
(Wells and Tailor 1987; Kermode, 2000, p. 18)
where the proportion of collaborative plays
written for the entrepreneur Philip Henslowe is
given as two-thirds.
Regarding the complexity arising from the three
central aspects—sequential development, generic
differences between plays, and questions of colla-
boration—it becomes clear that there will be no
plain answers. All one can do is to hint at certain
probabilities that would be supported by statistical
evidence. Regrettably it is the question of collabora-
tion that was left out in this contribution as it would
have involved the breaking down of speech length
distribution curves to the level of acts or even scenes.
The first observation refers to the arrangement of
plays as they came into existence. In the previous
chart that was reproduced in the Shakespeare-
Jahrbuch 2005 the dates of plays were extracted
from A Shakespeare Encyclopaedia by Campbell
and Quinn which had been published in 1966. It
accounted for nothing else but the division into
plays written before and after 1599 (Table 1).
Meanwhile a new sequence has been generally
acknowledged. It was also put down in Ina
Schabert’s Shakespeare Handbuch and records here
also the speech lengths that were most often used.
The first striking point is the fact that prior to
1599 there are four plays where the most often used
speech length is not eight or nine words any more
but six, and in the case of The Merry Wives of
Windsor even four.
But this would not contradict the main message
that the opening of the Globe in 1599 was the main
cause of aesthetic changes. As Shapiro was able to
show in various instances Shakespeare had been
trying for quite some time to introduce changes in
the aesthetic constituents of his plays. Shapiro’s
chapter A Battle of Wills in particular presents us

with Kemp’s acting style as Dogberry and Falstaff
and Shakespeare’s intentions to make his characters
more real (Shapiro, 2005, pp. 27–49).
Likewise, Kermode attaches importance to the
new quality of the last four plays before 1599
(Kermode, 2000, p. 48 ff) and he speaks of a new
prose.
Something else might be added: the constant
stream of foul papers apparently caused the Lord
Chamberlain’s Men to publish their own texts, and
this was done under the name of William
Shakespeare at least from 1598 (Shapiro, 2005;
Wells, 2006). This may have been another incentive
for the playwright to revise texts more carefully and
to imprint his own style on them to a greater degree
than ever before.
Irrespective of genre properties the following
graphs are displayed in the alleged sequence as the
plays emerged (Fig. 2). Frequency is displayed ver-
tically, and speech length up to twenty words is
given on the x-axis. This is the range where the
most notable changes can be observed, whereas
speech lengths of more than twenty words do
not contain noteworthy features. Identification
numbers were added to simplify the interpretation
of the graphs and this was done without referencing
mentally to title, genre, and possible collaborations.
It may well be seen as a cumbersome process
to recall the frequency distribution of speech
lengths for all plays in graphic charts, but they can
be regarded as a kind of fingerprint of stylistic
features. After all, speeches are what plays are
made of, and, as can be seen further down, the
term physiognomy might even fit better than
fingerprint.
In texts nos 4 (3Henry VI), 5 (1Henry VI), 6 (Titus
Andronicus), 7 (Richard III), 10 (Richard II), 13 (King
John), and perhaps also 20 (Julius Caesar), speech
lengths of twelve or thirteen words are almost
absent, i.e. they turn up only in very few num-
bers. None of these texts is a comedy. In Julius
Caesar (20) we have furthermore a play where the
maximum is at four words and the minimum at
eleven.
Although there is a visible tendency in many
more plays to divide the speech length distributions
between one and twenty words into two peaks
because of a hinted minimum at the values eleven,
twelve, and thirteen, it is in many cases obvious that
comedies do not fall into that category. Graph nos
16 (The Merry Wives of Windsor), 18 (Much Ado
about Nothing), 21 (As You Like It), 23 (Twelfth
Night), 25 (Measure for Measure), and 27 (All’s
Well That Ends Well) rise to their maximum
value(s) and then fall gently towards the speech
length of twenty words. The same applies to a
series of plays that have a certain period in
common: 15 (1Henry IV), 16 (The Merry Wives of
Windsor), 17 (2Henry IV), 18 (Much Ado about
Nothing), 19 (Henry V), 21 (As You Like It), and
23 (Twelfth Night). With the exception of Julius
Caesar and Hamlet, this applies to the sequence
from 1 Henry IV to Twelfth Night.
These observations are derived from mere visual
impressions, and the question arises as to how the
connection between the plays can be established in
more detail. Some metaphorical considerations
might be useful.
In her novel The Biographer’s Tale, Byatt (2000)
employs a first-person narrator who finds some
composite pictures. These had been composed
from individual photographs by Sir Francis
Galton, the eminent 19th century researcher. The
pictures of his three sisters put on top of each

other yielded a new composite photo that contained
the core of family resemblance, from which the indi-
vidual traits had originated. Similar pictures had
been produced from fellow soldiers and officers,
and from the wife and children of Linnaeus.
If the speech length distribution curve is taken as
a representation of an individual play, very much in
the same way as a photograph gives us the face of an
individual, and if we put members of the same
family or group together we should get such a

composite curve. It is obvious that the greater the
family likeness is the less difference there is in the
course of the curves. This was achieved by a process
of approximation, where the average of two curves
was formed and then with the addition of a third
curve the average of three curves was given and so
on. The guiding rule was to create a bundle of
curves with little variety. In this heuristic approach
such combinations of plays were excluded where
curves varied widely.

A large degree of variation could be expected
when a large number of plays were involved.
But even when we take up the already established
distinction between plays before and after 1599 the
curves clearly represent two different populations.
The composite curves are shown in (Fig. 3).
Admittedly some speech length values (x-axis)
vary noticeably because of the relatively large
number of plays, but both curve bundles correspond
to the total absolute values of speech lengths and to
the average percentages of speech-length distribu-
tion. What is most interesting now is the reproduc-
tion of a group of plays determined either by their
genre or their period of coming into existence.
1. Histories
The following composite curves represent the
speech length distribution of histories that were
written between 1591 and 1595 (Fig. 4). 2 Henry
VI was taken as a starting point with subsequent
plays (3 Henry VI; 1 Henry VI; Titus Andronicus;
Richard III; Richard II) being added.
Even though Titus Andronicus is not normally
counted among the histories, it was left here as it
belonged to the same creative period.
The outstanding features are two maxima, one
accounting for a speech length of nine words, the
other depicting mainly speeches of sixteen words. A
very prominent dip can be found at the speech
lengths of eleven and twelve words. The question
of why these speech lengths are obviously not
among the favored ones is difficult to answer. But
on the other hand, speech lengths between one and
five words move in the same range, which is the
more surprising if we think of the fact that in the
creative processes only a couple of years later shorter
speeches of four words would become dominant.
Apparently the dramatic speed that goes with
shorter speeches was not yet seen as crucial.
2. Comedies
The shape of the distribution of speech lengths sug-
gests a kinship between The Two Gentlemen of
Verona, and Love’s Labour’s Lost (Fig. 5).
Another pair of similar shapes can be seen in
The Taming of the Shrew and The Comedy of
Errors (Fig. 6).

In both examples, a third curve was added which
represents the average value of the two curves.
At the very first glance we see that there are
differences between the two graphs, and before
further conclusions are drawn it makes sense to
refer also to some later comedies (Fig. 7).
The three graphs seem to represent different
approaches as to the use of speech length.
Whereas The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Love’s
Labour’s Lost indicate a steeper rise to the value four
from which they rise again to a speech length of nine
words, The Taming of the Shrew and The Comedy of
Errors have two clearly distinct maxima, a smaller
maximum at four words and the dominant one at
nine words. This is contrasted by the later comedies,
starting with The Merry Wives of Windsor, where a
steep rise goes up to the value of four words, fol-
lowed by the gentle decline towards the value
twenty. To what degree the decrease from four to
twenty can be seen as a generic property only
becomes visible when a third dramatic type is
added for the purpose of comparison.

Tragedies
The four tragedies that were selected are
undoubtedly the most famous ones Shakespeare
ever wrote. Once again we see the steep rise towards
the value of four words, but then there is a very
sharp drop as well, and instead of falling gently
towards the value twenty as comedies do, the fre-
quency level between eleven and twenty words is
almost even. In fact, it looks as if this was a totally
different aesthetic concept with a particular focus on
shorter dialogical speeches creating suspense and
dramatic speed (Fig. 8).
1596–1598
Having viewed the generic propensities of compo-
site curves, I now want to take up the question
of what composite curves can contribute to the
crucial pre-1599 situation (Fig. 9). Instead of a max-
imum of either nine or four words in these
plays, the speech length of six words was
most often used, and in the case of The Merry
Wives of Windsor it was even the speech length of
four words.
The chart demonstrates clearly that the period
just before the changes brought about by the
Globe in 1599 already accounts for stylistic
changes. The composite curves do not only draw
attention to the maximum value of a speech
length of six words, but also to the clearly
visible (old) maximum of nine words. Not
surprisingly, though, there is also the speech
length of four words that is to dominate the plays
after 1599.
The chart thus illustrates the transitional
phase before 1599 when Shakespeare’s artistic
aspirations moved towards a new aesthetic achieve-
ment but were on the other hand still rooted in
old accomplishments. The least one can say is
that Shapiro’s findings are replicated in the compo-
site curves of speech length distributions. In
other words, speech length distribution curves
objectify research theses that refer to stylistic
changes.
