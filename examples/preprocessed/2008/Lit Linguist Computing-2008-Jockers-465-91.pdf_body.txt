processing script failed to account for the possibility that two hyphens (‘- -’) might be used as a substitute for the em dash. This resulted in a very small
number of word types being incorrectly tokenized and an even smaller number of miscounted words. For example, the ngram ‘age- -and’ was tokenized as
a unique word type instead of being counted as one instance each of the words ‘aged’ and ‘and’. Jockers became aware of this error on January 9, 2009 and
immediately corrected the tokenization script and reprocessed the data. Witten then reran both the winnowing algorithm and the NSC and Delta
procedures. The minor corrections to the data file did not result in any changes to the winnowed result set of words used by NSC. In all but one case, the
classification results given by NSC were also unchanged. The only change in classification occurred in chapter 147 (Alma 52) of the Book of Mormon.

second most likely. In the original results, NSC ranked Rigdon at 0.4646 and Spalding at 0.4628. With the corrected data, NSC ranked Rigdon at 0.4626

1 Background
Since its publication in March 1830, the origin of
the Book of Mormon—particularly its claim of
ancient origins—has been the subject of intense
scrutiny and debate. Mormon prophet Joseph
Smith Jr (1805–44) claimed that an angelic messen-
ger delivered to him a record written from around
2200 BC to 421 AD by ancient Native Americans
in ‘reformed Egyptian’. Smith claimed to have used
a seer stone to translate the record into English.
By February 1831, two competing theories had
appeared: Alexander Campbell (1831), founder
of the Campbellite religious movement, proposed
Smith himself as author while the Cleveland
Advertiser (1831) proposed Sidney Rigdon.1
Rigdon was a former Campbellite preacher who
acquired ecclesiastical status on par with Smith’s
almost immediately after his rapid conversion in
October 1830. Campbell (1844) eventually con-
cluded that Rigdon was the probable author of
the Book of Mormon, but his initial explanation
held that Smith wrote the book by drawing from
sermons and local folklore.2
One year later, in February 1832, a third candi-
date-author was named when Mormon missionaries
Orson Hyde and Samuel Smith read passages
from the Book of Mormon at a schoolhouse in
Conneaut (New Salem), Ohio. Nehemiah King,
who was present at these readings, claimed that
Hyde ‘had preached from the [novelistic] writings
of Solomon Spalding’ (Wright, 1833).3 Spalding
(often ‘Spaulding’) was a frustrated novelist who,
prior to his death in 1816 (i.e. from 1811 to
1815), shared his unpublished novel with his neigh-
bors, family, and associates in Conneaut. In 1833,
the Spalding allegations came to the attention
of E. D. Howe, who joined with ex-Mormon
Philastus Hurlbut to investigate the matter.
Hurlbut collected affidavits from Spalding’s former
neighbors and family in Conneaut.4 The witnesses
recalled having heard much of the plot and several
names from the Book of Mormon in a draft novel
titled ‘Manuscript Found’, a now-lost text that
Spalding submitted for publication to a Pittsburgh
publisher in late 1812. In Mormonism Unvailed [sic]
(1834, 1977) Howe linked Rigdon to Spalding
through this publisher. The resulting ‘Spalding-
Rigdon Theory’ holds that Rigdon acquired the
Spalding manuscript through his connections to
the Pittsburgh publishing shop, added his own
theology, and then revealed it to the public through
Smith as the Book of Mormon. In the years after
Howe’s publication, others provided testimony
supportive of the theory, including Spalding’s
widow, Spalding’s daughter, the owner of the
Pittsburgh publishing shop, and others who claimed
that Spalding shared his work with them5 or who
claimed to have seen a copy of ‘Manuscript Found’
after Spalding’s death.6 Expansions to the theory
followed, including a detailed analysis of Rigdon’s
life by William H. Whitsitt (1886, 1891), and of
other likely collaborators, including Smith’s second
cousin Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher with editing
experience (Deming, 1888) and Parley P. Pratt, a
former disciple of Rigdon (Schroeder, 1901).7
Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth
century, the Spalding-Rigdon Theory was the
favored explanation for the origin of the Book of
Mormon, but Fawn Brodie’s (1945) rejection of
this theory in her controversial biography of Smith
marked a turning point in the debate. Invoking
witness tampering and ‘false memory syndrome’,
Brodie dismissed the affidavits collected by
Hurlbut. She believed that a Spalding holograph
discovered in Honolulu, Hawaii, and stored within
a large envelope with the penciled-in title
‘Manuscript Story–Conneaut Creek’ (1810), was
in fact the lost Spalding document known to the
Conneaut witnesses as ‘Manuscript Found’.8
Despite having no evidence that the Honolulu
manuscript was the same text that the Conneaut
witnesses heard Spalding read to them (and subse-
quently recognized as a source text for the Book
of Mormon), Brodie nonetheless concluded that
Spalding could not have been an author of the
Book of Mormon because the similarities between

the Book of Mormon and the text found in Hawaii
were ‘not sufficient to justify the thesis of common
authorship’.9 Her rejection of the Spalding-Rigdon
Theory was so widely accepted that the Spalding-
Rigdon Theory came to be regarded by most stu-
dents of Mormon history as ‘an historiographical
artifact without credibility among serious scholars’
(Bushman, 2005).
Among contemporary secular scholars of
Mormonism, the theory of Smith as solitary
author is a generally accepted explanation.
Twentieth century advocacy of this theory began
with I. Woodbridge Riley (1902) who proposed
that Smith drew inspiration from locally available
source materials, including Ethan Smith’s (1825)
View of the Hebrews. Riley also speculated
that Joseph Smith’s writing was influenced by epi-
lepsy-induced visions and that Smith created char-
acters modeled on members of his family, including
himself. Brigham Roberts (1857–1933), a Mormon
leader and intellectual whose writings are collected
in Studies of the Book of Mormon (Madsen, 1985),
likewise concluded that Smith had the imagination
and source material to produce the Book of Mormon
on his own (1985). Smith’s textual sources, Roberts
argued, likely included View of the Hebrews and
Josiah Priest’s (1825) Wonders of Nature and
Providence. Brodie (1945) advanced similar argu-
ments, and followed Riley’s footsteps with specula-
tion regarding Smith’s psychology (1971). In recent
work, David Persuitte (2000) provides textual
parallels to strengthen connections to both Ethan
Smith and Josiah Priest, while historian Dan Vogel
(2004) expands the psychological speculation,
suggesting that the Book of Mormon is best explained
as the result of Smith family dynamics and Smith’s
willingness to engage in a pious fraud.
In addition to historical studies of Smith and
the origins of the Book of Mormon (such as those
noted above), there have been a smaller number
of quantitative, or ‘stylometric’, studies. A team of
Brigham Young University researchers led by
Wayne Larsen conducted the first among these
(Larsen 1980).10 Employing multivariate, cluster,
and classification analysis, Larsen, Rencher, and
Layton set out to test the proposition that the
Book of Mormon is the work of a single author
(perhaps Smith) or multiple authors (ancient or
nineteenth century). Larsen’s study included analy-
sis of thirty-eight frequently occurring common
non-contextual words and forty-two rarely occur-
ring non-contextual words. To generate frequency
lists, the researchers first assumed that ‘the writers
of each verse, or partial verse, could be identified
according to information given in the text’ and thus
they ‘assigned’ verses and partial verses to classes
based on their ‘careful scrutiny’ of the text (1980).
They concluded from statistical analysis of this
material that the text was not the work of Joseph
Smith and that many authors likely wrote it. Using
samples of known writings from Solomon Spalding,
Sidney Rigdon, and other Smith contemporaries,
Larsen claimed further that the multiple styles they
detected in the Book of Mormon were not likely to
be the work of any of these nineteenth-century
authors.
Several problems are now apparent in the meth-
odologies employed by Larsen et al. (1980). First,
they grouped verses and partial verses from the
Book of Mormon into clusters based on their under-
standing of speakers (or characters) in the Book of
Mormon (i.e. Nephi, Alma, etc.). Because the char-
acters had distinctive vocabulary ‘wordprints’
within these selections, they concluded that the
Book of Mormon was a multi-authored work.11
They further reasoned that because their selections
did not match the styles of potential nineteenth-
century authors, they could conclude that the text
was not the work of a nineteenth-century author.
However, their analysis did not exclude the possibi-
lity that their chosen selections were composites
containing different fractional contributions from
different nineteenth-century authors.
A further problem stems from Larsen’s reliance
upon context sensitive words. Though Larsen claims
to use only non-contextual words, his list of selected
words is questionable. It includes words such as
‘behold’, ‘forth’, ‘lest’, ‘nay’, ‘O’, ‘unto’, ‘wherefore’,
and ‘yea’—words that are common in scripture and
thus contextual. They occur at a much higher fre-
quency in the Book of Mormon than in the writings
of nineteenth-century authors. Take the word
‘unto’, for example: It occurs 3,610 times in the
Book of Mormon, a rate of 135 occurrences for

every 10,000 words. In the entire Chadwyck-Healey
(2000) Early American Fiction collection, a collec-
tion of 875 novels spanning the period from 1789 to
1875, the word ‘unto’ appears 2,346 times, a rate of
just 3.8 occurrences for every 10,000 words.12 Even
sympathetic scholars, such as the statistician D.
James Croft (1981), caution against reading too
much into Larsen’s results.13
In a paper from around 1988,14 Mormon inves-
tigator John L. Hilton claimed that his group had
significantly improved Larsen’s techniques and that
their results reconfirmed his conclusion that the
Book of Mormon is a work of multiple, though
ancient, authors. For his analysis of the Book of
Mormon, however, Hilton chose to analyze subjec-
tively grouped and edited selections from the Book
of Mormon put together in the form of 5,000 word
blocks of text. Like Larsen, Hilton assumed that
characters such as Nephi and Alma can be viewed
as candidate authors, and he selected blocks of text
from what he referred to as ‘didactic’ sections for
the characters ‘Nephi’ and ‘Alma’. He then followed
Larsen in assuming that each selection could only
be the work of a single nineteenth century author,
not the work of multiple nineteenth century
authors. At best, one might hope to conclude
from such an analysis that the chosen selections
are not by the same author, but the methodology
used does not exclude the possibility of multiple
nineteenth century authors. Hilton’s methodology
thus did not address a key aspect of the Book of
Mormon authorship question.
In Appendix 3 of his essay, Hilton identifies
the sources for his compilation: not a single manu-
script, or the published 1830 version of the Book of
Mormon, but instead, a composite compilation of
selections from four sources based upon what he
and his team judged to be the oldest. The prove-
nance of this material is questionable. Also prob-
lematic is that Hilton’s compilation of old
Mormon manuscripts did not include significant
sections and direct quotations from the King
James Bible—sections and quotations that are an
acknowledged part of the 1830 Book of Mormon.15
Most importantly, Hilton’s analysis neglected to
include a comparison with the work of Rigdon.
This omission is difficult to understand given the
other potential authors whose work Hilton
analyzed. In our work, we include a large amount
of newly available Rigdon text of certain prove-
nance, adding to the limited amount available at
the time of Larsen’s study.
More compelling than the work of Hilton and
Larsen is the work of statistician David Holmes
(1985, 1991a,b, 1992). In separate papers from
1991 and 1992, Holmes investigated Book of
Mormon authorship using a multivariate measure-
ment of vocabulary richness. Holmes compared the
Book of Mormon to thirteen writing samples
from Joseph Smith, Joanna Southcott, and the
King James Bible.16 He measured the richness of
noun usage in the various works: a technique that
Holmes claims enables him to discriminate between
the ‘personal’ and the ‘prophetic’ writings of Joseph
Smith as well as between the personal writings
of Smith and those of Joanna Southcott. Using
this technique, Holmes further discriminates
between the prophetic voice of Smith and that
of Southcott. Holmes’s derives the ‘signal’ for
Smith’s prophetic voice from Smith’s revelations
as they are recorded in Doctrine and Covenants;
the personal voice he derives from the letters
and diary entries collected in Dean Jessee’s The
Personal Writings of Joseph Smith.
Detecting differences between Smith’s prophetic
and personal voice was a key discovery for Holmes.
His technique appeared to prove effective in discrim-
inating between authors and between authorial
voices in different contexts. From this, Holmes
argued that his multivariate measurements of
vocabulary richness offered no evidence to support
the argument that the Book of Mormon is a work of
multiple authors. This conclusion stood in direct
contradiction to the previous analyses by Larsen
and Hilton. However, two problems are apparent
in Holmes’s work: first, his reliance upon the
letters and diary entries collected by Dean
C. Jessee in Personal Writings of Joseph Smith
(Smith and Jessee, 2002) as a reliable source for
Smith’s personal voice and second, his reliance
upon the Doctrine and Covenants as a reliable
source for Smith’s prophetic voice.
Though Holmes was careful to select ‘only those
letters written by Smith himself [in Smith’s hand],

or preserved in the handwriting of clerks who state
specifically that Smith is dictating’ (Holmes, 1991b),
even this subset of Dean Jessee’s collection is prob-
lematic. In the opening sentence of his introduc-
tion to Personal Writings of Joseph Smith, Jessee
declares: ‘it matters very little whether or not a
person writes his own journals, letters, and speeches
or delegates others to write for him’ (Jessee, 2002).
His point here is that even if written by others,
the material reflects the mind of the Smith if not
the actual words as written. For authorship attribu-
tion analysis, however, we are less concerned with
whether a document captures the ‘spirit’ of an
attributed author and more specifically interested
in whether the document is written by and in the
natural style of the attributed author. With Smith,
however, we cannot reasonably conclude this point,
that the documents attributed to him are indeed
reflections of his individual literary style. On the
contrary, in studying Smith and reading Jessee’s
collection of documents, one becomes immediately
and acutely aware of how little we can, even blithely,
attribute to Smith and Smith alone. Jessee notes
the problems associated with claiming that Smith
was the author of the words attributed to him:
‘His philosophy’ writes Jessee, ‘was that ‘‘a prophet
cannot be his own scribe’’ ’.17 Indeed, even Jessee
avoids use of the word ‘author’ preferring instead
‘writings attributed to him [Smith]’. Jessee points
out that while Smith ‘produced a sizable collection
of papers, the question remains as to how clearly
they reflect his own thoughts and personality
[because] we inherit the limitations that produced
them . . . the wide use of clerks taking dictation
or even being assigned to write for him, and the
editorial reworking of reports of what he did and
said’ (Smith and Jessee, 2002). Jessee notes further
that the ‘practice . . . of inserting eyewitness writings
that have been changed from indirect to direct
discourse . . . gives the impression that Joseph
wrote them’, when in fact he did not. Referring
to one particular case, Jessee writes that the ‘impres-
sions of Joseph Smith given . . . probably reflect
the personality of the editor more than they do
Joseph’s’. Even for the twenty-three letters in
Smith’s hand, which Jessee republishes in facsimile
form, we cannot easily assume that Smith is the sole
author. Many of the letters in Jessee’s collection
show the handwriting of Smith along side and inter-
mingled with the handwriting of other authors,
including Rigdon and Cowdery. Even when writing
something as personal as a journal entry or letter,
we see consistent evidence of collaboration and
co-authorship. Unfortunately, such writing cannot
be used as a reliable sample of known authorship.18
Second, and equally problematic, is Holmes’s
use of the Doctrine and Covenants as a reliable
example of Smith’s prophetic voice. This text of
revelations is ascribed to Smith, but as is the case
with many of his letters and diary entries, he did
not write it unaided. Rather, he is reported to have
dictated the revelations to one of his scribes. From
1829 to 1838, two of Smith’s main scribes were none
other than Sidney Rigdon and Oliver Cowdery, who
according to the Spalding-Rigdon theory, partici-
pated in writing the Book of Mormon. In fact, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the
Mormon Church) acknowledges that many sections
of the Doctrine and Covenants were revealed jointly
to Smith and Rigdon or to Smith and Cowdery.19
The voice signals of one of these men or a mix of
their signals could be the ‘prophetic voice’ Holmes
ascribes to Smith. That Holmes would find similar-
ities between the ‘prophetic’ voice of the Doctrine
and Covenants and the Book of Mormon, therefore,
is at best evidence of common authorship for the
two texts but in no way demonstrates that Smith’s
‘voice’ (divinely inspired or otherwise) is anywhere
to be found.20
2 A New Approach
For many, the question of who wrote the Book of
Mormon remains unresolved. Historical and stylo-
metric research has so far not given us a reliable
answer. We offer here a new approach that differs
from past work both in source selection and meth-
odology. We examine the entire 1830 Book of
Mormon without any a priori assumptions, modifi-
cations or pre-selection, and compare it to new,
candidate-author samples. Our methodology does
not isolate word categories (i.e. contextual or non-
contextual nouns), but instead uses the entire

corpus as a starting point and a mathematically
based selection process to define the features of
the author samples and the Book of Mormon that
we will compare. Our work employs two techniques
to determine the probability that each chapter of the
Book of Mormon was authored by each of seven
authors: Oliver Cowdery, Parley Pratt, Sidney
Rigdon, Solomon Spalding, Isaiah-Malachi (from
the Bible), Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Joel
Barlow. The first five have known or alleged con-
nections to the Book of Mormon. The last two are
prominent, period-authors who were added as
controls.21
The first technique, ‘delta’ (Burrows, 2002, 2003;
Hoover, 2004a,b) is well-documented in the litera-
ture of computational linguistics, so we omit a
detailed description here. The second is ‘nearest
shrunken centroids’ (NSC). NSC is a statistical tech-
nique for classification in high-dimensional settings.
The problem of authorship attribution is a classifi-
cation problem because we seek to classify a text
sample of unknown authorship into one of a fixed
number of known author categories—in this case a
closed set of candidate authors: Rigdon, Spalding,
Cowdery, Longfellow, etc. The problem is high-
dimensional because we seek to perform classifica-
tion on the basis of a very large number of words.
The method is as follows. First, we compute average
word frequency vectors, or centroids, for each
known author, on the basis of the text samples
of known authorship. Next, we shrink these cen-
troids towards the overall average word frequency
vector across all of the authors, in order to make
our method more robust to small changes in word
frequencies. Finally, we classify a text of unknown
authorship by computing its word frequency vector
and determining to which of the shrunken centroids
it is most similar. NSC was initially intended for
a completely different purpose: it was developed to
assist cancer diagnosis by classifying patient tumor
samples into cancer subtypes based on gene expres-
sion measurements. However, from a machine
learning perspective, the problem of authorship
attribution is surprisingly similar to that of cancer
diagnosis: rather than classifying tumors by cancer
subtype, we classify texts by author, and instead of
using gene expression measurements to perform
the classification, we use word frequencies.22 This
creates the seven author categories described
above. The same kind of analysis is then done
on a Book of Mormon chapter, and the resulting
pattern is compared to the pattern of each of the
seven potential author categories (Rigdon—90%;
Longfellow—1%; etc.) On this basis, NSC assigns
a probability that each potential author wrote each
Book of Mormon chapter; just as it would assign
a probability that a tissue sample manifests a partic-
ular cancer sub-type. More details regarding NSC
can be found in Tibshirani (2002, 2003).23
3 Source Selection
Because several theories for the origin of the Book of
Mormon propose multiple authorship, we cannot
investigate it as if it were a single unified text written
by a single author, but must instead break it into
meaningful samples. Smith reportedly dictated the
original document in a series of sessions with
scribes.24 These scribes allegedly wrote down every-
thing he said, without punctuation or attention to
grammatical form. A key scribe, Oliver Cowdery,
is alleged to have provided the initial editing
before publication. Subsequent editors altered
punctuation, improved grammar, eliminated redun-
dant phrases, and, in some cases, made changes in
the text’s content. Our investigation thus begins by
excluding any analysis of punctuation (e.g. comma
frequency) or of form (verse length, sentence length,
etc.), and is limited to words alone. Since it was
the published 1830 version of the text that was
authorized by the Mormon Church, we examine
the entire text, excluding only the chapter sum-
maries that appear before First Nephi, Second
Nephi, Jacob, Alma, Helaman, Third Nephi, Forth
Nephi, and Ether.
We opted to use the chapter structure currently
recognized by modern Mormon Church editors to
create our text samples. This results in a total of 239
text segments for testing. This approach yields texts
that are generally of adequate size (verses are too
small and books too large), recognizes natural
breaks in the narrative, facilitates cross-referencing

to online resources,25 and avoids the chance that we
have imposed our own bias. We consider it impor-
tant that this method tests the entire corpus
approved by Smith in 1830. Book of Mormon
samples averaged 1,117 words and ranged in
size from 95 to 3,752 words. Our candidate-author
samples were equally varied and ranged from a
small sample of 114 words to a large sample of
17,797 words with an average sample size of 2,172
words.26
For comparative purposes, we acquired digital
versions of the Books of Isaiah and Malachi from
the King James Bible as well as samples of known
writings of Solomon Spalding, Sidney Rigdon,
Parley Pratt, and Oliver Cowdery (Appendix A
provides a detailed list of source materials). For
control purposes, we selected two texts: Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow’s (1855) Song of Hiawatha
and Joel Barlow’s Columbiad (1825). Barlow and
Longfellow were initially selected as control authors
because both are roughly contemporary to the Book
of Mormon, both deal to an extent with concepts
found in the Book of Mormon, and both employ
formulaic patterns consistent with patterns of
verse seen in the Book of Mormon.27 To further
test the appropriateness of these control texts, we
performed a series of simple hierarchical classifica-
tion tests using frequently occurring non-contextual
words and fifty novels of the same era (1789–1850).28
The texts written by Longfellow and Barlow consis-
tently clustered close to the Book of Mormon indicat-
ing that they were appropriate choices for use as
control texts. The Isaiah and Malachi texts also
served as pseudo-control texts, since large sections
of the Book of Mormon are known to be almost ver-
batim extracts from them.29 All of the known author
samples were segmented in order to obtain estimates
of the variance associated with each author’s word
use. In total, 239 chapters of the Book of Mormon and
217 samples of known authorship were tested.
Using scripts developed for this project, each
sample was tokenized in order to produce word
counts and relative frequency data for each word
within each sample.30 We did not include Joseph
Smith in the analysis because, as noted above,
there is currently no reliable corpus of Joseph
Smith text.
4 Methodology
As described in the previous section, our data con-
sist of 239 samples of unknown authorship (corre-
sponding to chapters from the Book of Mormon) and
217 samples written by seven known authors. We
refer to this analysis as the ‘seven-author case’. The
number of text samples used for this analysis is
as follows: Cowdery (nineteen), Pratt (fifty-three),
Rigdon (twenty-three), Spalding (seventeen),
Isaiah-Malachi (seventy), Barlow (twelve), and
Longfellow (twenty-three). We used a set of 110
words or ‘features’, obtained in three steps:
(1) We selected the words that occurred at least
once in the samples from each author and
also at least once in the Book of Mormon.
This resulted in a set of 521 words.
(2) We selected the subset of these 521 words that
have a mean relative frequency, across the
456 samples, of at least 0.1%. This resulted
in a set of 114 words.
(3) We removed the words ‘god’, ‘ye’, ‘thy’, and
‘behold’, as these occurred at much higher
frequencies in texts relating to biblical subject
matter.
The resulting list of 110 words is available in
Appendix B.31
In order to compute delta scores and apply
NSC, we first converted the 110 word counts for
each text into relative word frequencies. For NSC,
we formatted the data as a matrix of dimension
456 110 (number of samples by number of
words). We subtracted out the mean from each
column and divided the entries in each column
by the standard deviation for that column. We
then applied NSC to the data, using the ‘pamr’
(Prediction Analysis for Microarrays) package that

Both delta and NSC involve the selection of
tuning parameters. For both methods, this tuning
parameter determines the number of words to
include in the classifier. In order to determine the
success rates of NSC and delta at classifying chapters
of known authorship, and in order to select a
value for the tuning parameters, we performed

cross-validation. Roughly speaking, cross-validation
is performed as follows, for a range of values of the
tuning parameter:
(1) Randomly split the samples of known author-
ship into two sets: a ‘training set’, containing
most of the samples, and a ‘test set’, contain-
ing a smaller portion of the samples.
(2) Perform the classification method of interest
(either delta or NSC) for a given value of the
tuning parameter, training on the training set
and testing on the test set.
(3) Compute the error fraction from the number
of misclassified test set samples.
Cross-validation allowed us to estimate the error
that we would obtain if we tried to classify the
samples of known authorship using NSC and delta.
The above process was repeated multiple times, and
the average misclassification error rate recorded.
The lowest delta error rate of 11.1% was obtained
using ninety words. This means that if we used delta
to classify a new sample written by one of the seven
known authors, then the probability of correct clas-
sification would be 88.9%. The lowest NSC error
rate was obtained when all 110 words were included;
the error rate was 8.8%. This means that we would
expect to classify correctly a new sample written
by one of the seven candidate authors 91.2% of
the time. Since there are seven candidate authors,
a classifier that selected an author completely at
random would give a correct classification rate of
1/7 or 14.3%, and an average misclassification error
rate of 6/7, or 85.7%. Therefore, the low error rates
obtained using NSC and delta are impressive. The
fact that NSC results in lower error rates indicates
that this method is appropriate for authorship attri-
bution, and may in this case be superior to delta.
Using delta, five of the 239 chapters of the
Book of Mormon were incorrectly assigned to con-
trol author Longfellow (none to Barlow), an error
rate of 2.1%. Using NSC, only two chapters
were assigned incorrectly to Longfellow (none to
Barlow), an error rate of 0.8%. To provide best
estimates of individual chapter authorship for
the five authors who are linked historically to the
Book of Mormon (Spalding, Rigdon, Cowdery, and
Pratt) or who are known to have contributed
(Isaiah-Malachi), we also performed a second delta
and NSC analysis (hereafter referred to as the ‘five-
author case’) in which we omitted the Barlow and
Longfellow control texts. In the five-author case,
the lowest NSC error rate was obtained using 108
words (listed in Appendix B).
5 Results
For each chapter of the Book of Mormon, using both
NSC and delta, we compared the relative probability
that a candidate author or a control author contrib-
uted to that chapter. We then established a ‘ranking’
for each of the seven authors (1–7) from most likely
to least likely and calculated the percentage point
difference between candidates in terms of their
probability. In Alma forty-seven (Chapter 147), for
example, the first place ranked candidate (using
NSC) has a probability of 46.5% where the second
place candidate is 46.3%. Given this close proximity,
it would be impossible to conclude that one candi-
date is more likely than the other. In the majority
of chapters, however, we do not observe this sort
of close probability between first and second candi-
dates. Most chapters (57%) show at least a fifty
percentage point difference between first and
second choice. Indeed, in forty chapters (17%),
the difference between first and second most prob-
able author is over ninety percentage points. Second
Nephi twenty-two (chapter forty-four), for example,
is a chapter known to contain strong borrowings
from the Book of Isaiah. NSC ranks the probability
of Isaiah-Malachi as the source for this chapter at
99.99%. In fact, twenty of the twenty-one chapters
known to have been borrowed from Isaiah or
Malachi are properly attributed at a probability at
or above 91% certainty.33 There was thus only one
‘false negative’ for chapters that are known to be
derived from Isaiah-Malachi (Mosiah fourteen is
borrowed from Isaiah fifty-three but was attributed
to Longfellow). This is evidence for the effectiveness
of NSC classification. Further evidence comes
from a consideration of ‘false positives’—chapters
attributed incorrectly to Isaiah-Malachi. There are
twenty-one known Isaiah chapters and another
sixteen that have some relationship to Isaiah or
Malachi (about 15% of the chapters in the Book of

Mormon). But delta assigns 47% to Isaiah-Malachi,
while NSC assigns 27%. This indicates that both
delta and NSC had ‘false positives’ for Isaiah-
Malachi, but the NSC false positive error rate was
about half that of delta.
NSC and delta agree on the first place assignment
for 147 of 239 chapters (62% agreement). In cases
where there is not first place agreement between
the two methods, there are seventy-six chapters
in which the first place candidate of one method
agrees with the second place candidate in the
other. There are a total of 223 chapters (93%) in
which the two methods name the same author in
either the first or second place. In the 147 chapters
where both methods agree on first place, there
are two chapters assigned to Cowdery, two
to Longfellow, four to Pratt, thirty-four to
Spalding, forty-six to Rigdon, and fifty-nine to
Isaiah-Malachi. In the seventy-six chapters where
there is agreement between a first choice in one
method and a second choice in another, there are
forty-two cases, which are inverses of each other,
that is there are forty-two cases in which the
author listed as first place in one method is listed
in second place in the other method. In these
instances, there are nine cases in which Rigdon is
paired with Cowdery, twenty cases in which Rigdon
is paired with Isaiah-Malachi, eight cases in which
Rigdon is paired with Spalding, two cases in which
Spalding is paired with Pratt, and three cases in
which Spalding is paired with Isaiah-Malachi.
Examining the NSC results (Table 1), we note
the following for the most likely positions of the
first and second most probable candidate: Rigdon
is either the first or second most probable candidate
author in 197 out of 239 chapters; Spalding is either
the first or second most likely candidate in 110
out of 239 chapters; and Isaiah-Malachi is first or
second in 101 chapters. Cowdery appears thirty-
seven times in first or second place and Pratt
appears twenty-four times. Barlow is never seen in
first place and appears only once in second place.
Longfellow is first in just two chapters and second
in only six. Additionally, we note that for the least
likely positions of the sixth and seventh most prob-
able candidates, Rigdon never shows up in last
(seventh) place and appears only twice in sixth
place. Spalding never shows up in either seventh
(last) or sixth place. Isaiah-Malachi appears four
times in last place and fourteen times in sixth.
Cowdery appears 116 times in sixth or seventh
place, Pratt thirty-four times. Barlow appears
in the sixth or seventh place 175 times and
Longfellow 133 times. Table 2 shows similar results
generated from the delta classification.
Summing the probabilities for each candidate-
author across the entire Book of Mormon, allows
visualization of the relative presence of each candi-
date-author’s ‘signal’ in the overall text (Figs 1
and 2).
In both classification methods, the signals for
Rigdon, Isaiah-Malachi, and Spalding are dominant
and the signals for control authors Longfellow and
Barlow are comparatively small or altogether absent.
The Pratt and Cowdery signals are present but small
beside the signals for Rigdon, Isaiah-Malachi and
Spalding. Both NSC and delta tend to agree closely
in terms of the relative presence of the Rigdon and
Spalding signals. The greatest disagreement between
the two methods appears in relation to the Isaiah-
Malachi signal where delta assigns 47% of the chap-
ters to Isaiah-Malachi as a first choice while NSC

assigns 28%. The actual Isaiah-Malachi percentage
can be estimated at around 36 chapters, or 15% of
all chapters. In other words, 15% of the Book of
Mormon is derived from Isaiah-Malachi or contains
excerpts from Isaiah-Malachi. This indicates that
while both delta and NSC had false positives, NSC
had many fewer and is closer to the actual or true
value.

for 223 of the 239 chapters (93% agreement).
6 Discussion
In the cross-validation tests, NSC was more effec-
tive, so our discussion and conclusions are based
on the NSC data unless otherwise specified. Use of
NSC enabled assignment of author probabilities
based on the closeness of each chapter within the
Book of Mormon to the known linguistic signals of
a set of candidate nineteenth-century authors. These
probabilities in turn made it possible to gauge the
relative presence of one signal over another. The
low signals for the control texts indicate that NSC
effectively identified and did not select the control
authors (Figs 5 and 6).
At a macro level, the signals for Rigdon, Isaiah-
Malachi, and Spalding dominate the Book of
Mormon, with NSC assigning 85% of the text to
one of these three candidate authors (delta assigns
93% to these three). Taken together, Rigdon and
Spalding account for 57% of the first place assign-
ments and 68% of the second place assignments.
Isaiah-Malachi accounts for 28% of the first place
assignments and 16% of the second place assign-
ments. Overall only ten chapters lack a signal for
Rigdon or Spalding in one of the two most probable
positions and four of these ten chapters are chapters
known to be derived from the Book of Isaiah,
as discussed below. In other words, of the 239 chap-
ters in the Book of Mormon, 229 show either the
Rigdon or Spalding signal prominently. Together
Rigdon and Spalding receive 64% of the combined
first and second place assignments, Isaiah-Malachi
receives 21% and other candidates or control
authors receive 15% (Fig. 3).
It is well-accepted that some chapters from the
Old Testament books of Isaiah and Malachi served
as source material for the Book of Mormon. Both
delta and NSC correctly classified all twenty-one
chapters of the Book of Mormon that contain
strong borrowings from Isaiah and/or Malachi,
and all were classified with a probability at or
above 84% by NSC.34 That said, both methods
also detected the Isaiah-Malachi signal in chapters
that are not obviously derived from the Old
Testament. For NSC, there are forty-three such
chapters and, in thirty-six of these, the probabili-
ties strongly favor Isaiah-Malachi over the other
possible candidates.35 These are chapters where
the style and word usage patterns are close to
those in the Old Testament. Others (Walters,
1990; Tanner, 1998; Marquardt, 2000; Persuitte,
2000; Palmer, 2002) have spent considerable time
tracing the direct correspondences between the
Book of Mormon and the King James version of
the Bible, so we will not delve into the specifics
of these Isaiah-Malachi attributions other than to
note that fifteen of these thirty-six chapters are
directly related to Isaiah and one of the thirty-six
is a chapter borrowed from the New Testament.36
Discounting the sixteen chapters that have some
connection to the Bible, this leaves twenty chapters
attributed to Isaiah-Malachi for reasons that are
not obvious. We note, however, that many of
these twenty chapters have thematic similarity to
Ethan Smith’s View of the Hebrews (Walters, 1990;
Persuitte, 2000), which is believed by many to be
linked to the Book of Mormon through Cowdery,37
and a future analysis might utilize Ethan Smith’s
text as a potential source. Figure 7A shows the
relative presence of the Isaiah-Malachi signal
across the entire Book of Mormon and Fig. 7B
shows chapters attributed to Isaiah-Malachi.
The prominence of the Rigdon and Spalding
signals are significant and provide strong support
for the Spalding-Rigdon authorship theory: that
Rigdon acquired one or more manuscripts written
by Spalding and then modified them, by incorpor-
ating his own theology, to create the 1830 version
of the Book of Mormon. Figure 8A illustrates the
presence of the Rigdon signal through each chapter
of the Book of Mormon, and Fig. 8B shows chapters
attributed to Rigdon. The graph shows a dominant
Rigdon signal in First Nephi, the non-Isaiah fraction
of Second Nephi, Jacob, Enos, Words of Mormon,
Mosiah, Helaman, the non-Isaiah fraction of Third
Nephi, Mormon, Ether, and Moroni, with an inter-
mittently strong signal in the Book of Alma.
Especially, noteworthy here is the fairly regular dis-
tribution of the signal across the entire text. A gap
in the Rigdon signal appears in sections known to

be copied from Isaiah (Fig. 7), in portions of the
book of Alma attributed to Spalding (Fig. 9), and
it is sporadic in the first quarter of the text, in
the section known to scholars of Mormonism as
replacement material added after Smith’s loss of
116 pages he claimed to have translated.38 The lost
pages contained material that would have ended
near the beginning of the Book of Mosiah. It is
generally held that Smith resumed his purported
translation at Mosiah and continued through to
the end of the Book of Mormon, returning at the
end of the process to replace the lost pages. One
possible scenario is that Smith and/or Rigdon
prepared a replacement in fall of 1828 by drawing
from source material at hand such as the Book of
Isaiah (which features prominently in this part
of the text) and perhaps from Ethan Smith’s View
of the Hebrews.
Figure 9A illustrates the presence of the Spalding
signal through each chapter of the Book of Mormon
and Fig. 9B the chapters attributed to Spalding.
Noteworthy here is (1) the small Spalding signal
in sections of the Book of Mormon that were likely
added to replace the 116 pages (i.e. the first quarter
of the book—First Nephi through Words of
Mormon), and (2) the fact that the chapters with
a dominant Spalding signal are primarily narrative
and non-theological, and thus consistent with

descriptions of ‘Manuscript Found’, the missing
Spalding document that is alleged to be founda-
tional to the Book of Mormon (Howe, 1834, 1977).
The prominence of the Spalding signal in the Book
of Alma is especially noteworthy. Dale Broadhurst
has identified these chapters as likely Spalding
contributions based on his careful comparison
of phrases found both in the Book of Alma and
Spalding’s ‘Manuscript Story’.39 Similar thematic
and linguistic patterns between the Book of
Mormon and Spalding’s ‘Manuscript Story’ have
also been identified by Holley (1989).40
Figure 10A shows the distribution of the Oliver
Cowdery signal and Fig. 10B the chapters attributed
to Cowdery.41 The Cowdery signal is most promi-
nent in the middle third of the book with a strong
cluster of authorial assignments (fourteen first-place
and four second-place) in the Book of Alma. Where
Cowdery is the most probable author, he is paired
with Rigdon as second most probable author in all
but two cases; where Cowdery is assigned as second
most probable author (seventeen chapters), Rigdon
is first most likely in fourteen of these. All of this
suggests a strong correlation between Cowdery
and Rigdon and the likelihood that if Cowdery con-
tributed to the Book of Mormon, he may have done
so in collaboration with Rigdon. The Cowdery
signal appears only where the Rigdon signal is also

prominent and in many cases the difference between
the strength of the two signals is marginal. Also
noteworthy is that the Cowdery signal appears
most prominently in the middle third of the
book. His signal appears after the Book of Mosiah
and near the beginning of the Book of Alma—the
point in the manuscript where Smith supposedly
began to dictate with Cowdery as his scribe,
and when the speed of translation reportedly
increased significantly.42 It is in these sections of
the Book of Mormon, especially the third quarter of
the Book of Alma, that we find the Cowdery
signal—in well-composed chapters that deal with
such topics as the nature of faith (Alma thirty-
two), atonement through Christ (Alma thirty-
six),43 and liberty (Alma sixty-one). Still, if
Cowdery had a direct hand in the authorship of
the Book of Mormon it was likely a lesser one.44
It is more likely that his primary role was editorial
given both the historical and stylometric data.

P. Pratt signal and Fig. 11B the chapters attributed

early leader in the Mormon church and one of the
original Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1826,
however, he was a wandering tin peddler who
‘knew everybody in Western New York and

He lived near Rigdon’s residence in Bainbridge,
Ohio, and joined Rigdon’s congregation.46 During
the same period, Rigdon is reported to have collab-
orated with ‘two or three different persons’ in
‘adjacent places’ to create the Book of Mormon.47
Sometime around 1827, Pratt decided to sell all his
goods and take up the ministry. It has been suggested
that Pratt was ‘the medium through whom Rigdon
made the acquaintance of Smith when seeking a sui-
table tool for his purpose’ (Williams, 1842; Eaton,
1882).48 While traveling in 1830, ostensibly to see
family, Pratt reported sudden inspiration that led
him to Palmyra, New York, where he quickly con-
verted to Mormonism and was baptized by Oliver
Cowdery. He and Cowdery then reportedly deliv-
ered a copy of the published 1830 version of the
Book of Mormon to Rigdon. Pratt’s conversion is

described in contradictory accounts, as is his role
in delivering the Book of Mormon to Rigdon
(Schroeder, 1901).
In five of the nine chapters attributed to Pratt,
Pratt is paired with Spalding in second place and
in four with Rigdon in second place. Pratt receives
fifteen second-place assignments: most of them
(ten) as a second to Spalding, and three as a
second to Rigdon. The largest proportion (one-
third) of the assignments to Pratt as the second
most probable author occurs in Alma, and there
are two cases in First Nephi. If Pratt contributed
to the Book of Mormon, he played a minor role
and was likely most involved in First Nephi, where
there are several first and second place Pratt
assignments.
In the stylometric studies cited earlier, Larson
et al. (1980) and Hilton (1988) attempted to test
the hypothesis that the Book of Mormon’s pur-
ported ancient authors had dissimilar writing
styles. Recent studies in cultural and linguistic
evolution suggest another relevant hypothesis by
demonstrating that writing styles in ancient texts
tend to become increasingly divergent over time
(Farmer, 2006). Our chapter-by-chapter analysis
tested both hypotheses and found that the Book of

Mormon does not display patterns consistent with
the type of ancient record it purports to be.
For example, two of the Book of Mormon’s alleged
principal authors were Nephi and Moroni. They
allegedly lived about 1,000 years apart. NSC
assigned many of their chapters to Rigdon. For
example, NSC assigned both First Nephi ten and
Moroni eight to Rigdon with >93% probability.
The Book of Mormon also attributes many
chapters to a single ancient author, but our results
frequently disconfirmed this. For example, where
the Book of Mormon attributes Mormon five,
six, and seven to an ancient author named
Mormon, NSC assigned chapters five and seven
to Rigdon (89 and 92% probability, respectively)
and chapter six to Spalding (72% probability).
Chapters five and seven contain references to
the future redemption of the House of Israel, a con-
cept popular in the early nineteenth century
and embraced by Rigdon, while chapter six is a
war narrative similar to other such narratives
penned by Spalding, a veteran of the American
Revolutionary War. These results stand in contrast
to claims that the Book of Mormon is of ancient
authorship.
7 Conclusions
NSC has proved highly useful for authorship classi-
fication. It has a lower cross-validation error rate
than delta, a lower rate of false positive assign-
ments, and a probability-based output that enabled
in-depth interpretation of the results, including
speculation regarding possible connections between
candidate authors. The NSC results are consistent
with the Spalding-Rigdon theory of authorship.
Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the
prominence of signals for Spalding and Rigdon;
the presence of strong Spalding signals in sections
of the Book of Mormon previously linked to
Spalding; the presence of a dominant Rigdon
signal in most theological sections, and a strong
Spalding signal in the more secular, narrative sec-
tions. Our findings are consistent with historical
scholarship indicating a central role for Rigdon in
securing and modifying a now-missing Spalding
manuscript. The high number of Spalding-Rigdon
pairings in first and second place strongly suggests
that Spalding and Rigdon were responsible for a
large part of the text. Pearson’s chi-square test of
independence was performed and indicates that
the distribution of first-place assignments is signifi-
cantly different from uniform (P < 2 1016).
Similarly, the distribution of second-place assign-
ments differs significantly from uniform
(P < 2 1016). Clearly, far more chapters are
attributed to Rigdon, Spalding, and Isaiah-Malachi
than might be expected due to mere chance. Other
connections detected through this work are also
consistent with the historical record, including
the likelihood of a lesser, largely editorial role for
Cowdery and a possibly minor, if unexpected, role
for Pratt.
Based on this evidence, we find the original
claims of Howe (1834, 1977) and the more recent
assertions of Cowdrey and coworkers quite plausi-
ble; it seems likely that the 1830 version of the
Book of Mormon was the creation of Sidney
Rigdon, a Reformed Baptist Preacher, who had
motives, means, and opportunity to carry out the
project (Cowdrey et al., 2005). We acknowledge
that because our samples of Rigdon prose all come
after 1830, some could argue that Rigdon’s prose
was influenced by the Book of Mormon and not
vice versa. To raise such an objection, however,
one would have to argue that Rigdon was so influ-
enced by the Book of Mormon that he consciously or
unconsciously adopted, even internalized, the most
subtle and unremarkable linguistic patterns found
in certain portions of the text, but not in others.
Prior exposure to the Book of Mormon most
certainly did not influence Solomon Spalding who
died fourteen years before it was published. Yet our
data strongly support the historical claim that a lost
Spalding manuscript served as a source text for
the backbone narrative of the Book of Mormon.
The document that we used for samples of
Spalding’s writing (‘Manuscript Story’ also known
as ‘The Oberlin Manuscript’) does not match the
eyewitness descriptions of ‘Manuscript Found’,
the draft novel that Spalding read to friends and
family in Conneaut, nor does it match the Book of
Mormon.49 The Spalding-Rigdon theory rests

heavily on the assumption that additional Spalding
manuscripts once existed, and that material from
one of these manuscripts provided the narrative
framework for the Book of Mormon. This additional
manuscript would be the one that the Conneaut
witnesses and others identified as being the
‘source’ of the Book of Mormon. While not that
manuscript, the Oberlin Manuscript nevertheless
provides us with a reliable sample of Spalding’s
prose and the linguistic signal detected in it appears
with significant regularity throughout the Book of
Mormon.
Of course, we have not considered every possible
candidate-author who may have influenced the
composition of the Book of Mormon. We have,
however, selected from among the most likely
candidates, excepting perhaps Joseph Smith. In the
case of Joseph Smith, we had no reliable samples
of prose to test. When reliably identified materials
become available, their addition to this analysis
would be worth considering. An effort to compile
such writings is currently underway.50
Knowledge of who likely constructed the Book of
Mormon has significant implications for scholarship
in Mormon history and for religious and cultural
studies generally, as it addresses the foundation of
an emerging world religion now estimated at thir-
teen million members. Our analysis supports the
theory that the Book of Mormon was written by
multiple, nineteenth-century authors, and more
specifically, we find strong support for the
Spalding-Rigdon theory of authorship. In all the
data, we find Rigdon as a unifying force. His signal
dominates the book, and where other candidates are
more probable, Rigdon is often hiding in the
shadows.51

8 The document was found in 1884 by James H. Fairchild
and is now stored at the Mudd Library of Oberlin
College.
9 The original basis for this argument is a statement
made by James H. Fairchild in the New York Observer
on 5 February 1885, immediately after his discovery of
the Spalding Manuscript in Honolulu, Hawaii: ‘The
theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon in the
traditional manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will
probably have to be relinquished . . . Mr. Rice, myself,
and others compared it with the Book of Mormon, and

could detect no resemblance between the two in general
or detail. Some other explanation of the origin of the
Book of Mormon must be found, if an explanation is
required.’ Also see http://www.solomonspalding.com/
docs2/1886Fair.htm#fairchild1.
What is often not mentioned is Fairchild’s later retrac-
tion published by Schroeder (1901): ‘With regard to the
manuscript of Mr Spaulding now in the Library
of Oberlin College, I have never stated, and know of
no one who can state, that it is the only manuscript
which Spaulding wrote, or that it is certainly the one
which has been supposed to be the original of the Book
of Mormon. The discovery of this Ms does not prove
that there may not have been another, which became
the basis of the Book of Mormon. The use which
has been made of statements emanating from me as
implying the contrary of the above is entirely unwar-
ranted. JAMES H. FAIRCHILD.’ Also, relevant is the
final statement of Rice (1886):
The Spaulding Manuscript recently discovered
in my possession, and published by the
Mormons, in no wise determines the question
as to the authorship of the Book of Mormon,
or of Spaulding’s connection with the latter.
It shows conclusively that this writing of
Spaulding was not the original of the Book of
Mormon—nothing more in that regard. It gives
the Mormons the advantage of calling upon
their opponents to produce or prove that any
other Spaulding Manuscript ever existed—and
that is the gist of the whole matter. Until lately
I have been of the opinion that there was
no tangible evidence that any other production
of Solomon Spaulding, bearing upon the ques-
tion, could be shown as having ever existed.
But correspondence and discussions growing
out of the publication of this document, have
shaken my faith in that belief, and indeed pro-
duced quite a change of opinion on that subject.

10 Less influential was Taves’s (1984) which relied heavily
on the disputed methodologies of Morton (1978).
11 A further problem with the Larsen study is the obser-
vation made by Burrows (1987) in his study of Jane
Austen’s fiction that authors can create distinct voices
within their own prose. Having said that, differences
between author ‘voices’ are generally less than that
between different authors.

14 There are at least three different versions of Hilton’s

Authorship’ available. One version can be found
as an undated PDF file in the online BYU Studies
archive, see http://byustudies.byu.edu/. Another copy

ments using ‘‘wrap-around’’ block counting’, FARMS.
FARMS, the Foundation for Ancient Research and
Mormon Studies, was recently renamed ‘The
Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship’ and is
located at Brigham Young University. A third source

15 One could argue that Hilton’s decision to remove
these biblical sections was reasonable given that the
authors he was testing for could not have written
these sections. In our analysis we leave these sections
in as an additional test of our methodology. A full
explanation is provided in the methodology section
of this article.
16 Joanna Southcott was a late-eighteenth century,
self-proclaimed, prophet with no connection to the
Book of Mormon. She was selected by Holmes as
a figure similar to Smith who could be used for
comparative purposes in his analysis.

18 We are aware of objections made to the entire concept
of ‘authorship’, objections put forth by theorists such
as Stanley Fish and Roland Barthes who have pro-
claimed that the idea of ‘authorship’ is flawed or
‘dead’. It is not our intention to enter these highly
theorized debates but rather to proceed from the
assumption that writers do actually write documents
and that the documents they write can, with appro-
priate evidence, be reasonably attributed to their
authors. In the case of Joseph Smith, we do not believe
that even the small number of letters written in his
own hand can be reasonably attributed to him.
Moreover, were we to concede the reliability of these
few letters, we would still not have enough text to
constitute an ample sample of known authorship.
This is a regrettable circumstance, and we do hope

to Smith and Cowdery.
20 In another paper, also published in 1991, Holmes
includes the Book of Abraham along with the
Doctrine and Covenants in order to develop Smith’s
‘prophetic’ voice. The problems we identify with the
Doctrine and Covenants are similar in the Book of
Abraham.
21 Choosing appropriate controls to use in conjunction
with the Book of Mormon was not a trivial matter.
The rationale for our choice is delineated in the sec-
tion of this article titled ‘Source Selection’.
22 More specifically, NSC works by computing a vector
of ‘average word frequencies’ for each author and
shrinking this vector towards the overall average
word frequency vector across all authors in order to
reduce the variance and avoid over-fitting the data.
A test set sample is then classified by computing its
distance to the word frequency vector for each known
author, while incorporating knowledge about the
variance for each author.

24 In early July of 1828, Smith lost the first 116 pages
of his alleged translation of the inscribed gold plates.
Prior to this loss, Smith claimed to have translated
the plates by means of the ‘urim and thummim’,
a Hebrew instrument of divination that, according
to Smith, consisted of a pair of stones fastened to a
breastplate and joined in a form similar to that of
a large pair of spectacles. When Smith resumed the
alleged translation after loss of the 116 pages, however,
he reportedly dictated all of the 582 pages of the 1830
Book of Mormon (including large sections quoted
verbatim from the Book of Isaiah) by gazing into
a hat in which he held a ‘seer stone’ that allowed
him to ‘see’ the words in English and to thus read
from the gold plates that were often purportedly
hidden to avoid theft. This seer stone was a stone
previously used by Smith to look for gold treasures
allegedly buried on the land of local farmers, a practice
for which Smith was prosecuted (successfully) in a
court of law. For a fee, Smith and his associates
would dig for treasures at locations identified
with the aid of the seer stone. Inevitably, the
treasures were cursed and ‘slippery’, preventing their
recovery.
25 See for example: http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/contents
26 It warrants note that in our cross-validation tests,
we did not observe a correlation between whether an
author was correctly assigned and the length of a text
sample. After NSC and delta author assignments
were made, we further tested the results for any pos-
sible correlation between the size of a Book of Mormon
chapter and the author assigned to that chapter. Again
no correlation was observed.
Sample sizes varied as follows:
 Average Book of Mormon sample size 1,117 (range
91–3,752)
 Average Rigdon sample size 4,561 (range
226–17,797)
 Average Spalding sample size 2,373 (range
777–8,515)
 Average Cowdery sample size 1,600 (range
200–10,712)
 Average Pratt sample size 3,024 (range 114–16,468)
 Average Longfellow sample size 1,354 (range
668–2,188)
 Average Barlow sample size 5,460 (range
2,843–6,984)
 Average Isaiah/Malachi sample size 554 (range
134–1,131)
27 For example, the Longfellow and Barlow texts fre-
quently open verses with the word ‘and’ as well as
frequently stringing together multiple short phrases.
Also evident in the three texts is the use of epic or
‘biblical’ language with a propensity for repetition.
28 Fifty novels written by fifteen different authors (twelve
male, three female) were selected from the Chadwyck
Healey Nineteenth Century American Literature col-
lection. Selection was based solely on publication date
(e.g. chronological proximity to the 1,830 publication
of the Book of Mormon). From these texts we extracted
word frequency data and employed hierarchal cluster-
ing (‘hclust’ function with complete linkage) to group
the texts based on their similarity. The cluster dendro-
grams produced by R can be found in the online sup-
porting materials at http://purl.stanford.edu/
ir:rs276tc2764
29 It has been suggested to the authors that the passages
from Isaiah and Malachi that appear verbatim in the
Book of Mormon might be removed from our candi-
date author samples and perhaps even replaced by
similar books from the Bible. Our purpose in keeping
these passages was intentional and meant to serve
as an added test of our methodology. Had NSC
failed to assign those chapters of the Book of
Mormon that contain significant borrowings from
Isaiah and/or Malachi to our Isaiah/Malachi sample,

then we would have had grounds to question the
effectiveness of our classifications overall. As it
turned out, NSC effectively assigned to Isaiah/
Malachi even those chapters where the direct borrow-
ings were subtle.

31 In order to avoid the problems that John Burrows
(2005) indentifies in his study of Shamela, our meth-
odology selects for words common to all authors
and then, to control for infrequent words that might
be common to only one author and the target text,
we further winnow the selection to contain only
words that appear at a rate of 0.1%. On this point,
Hoover (2002) is also instructive. In his analysis
of frequent word sequences, Hoover culls from analy-
sis words that are unique to a single text and words
with ‘obviously peculiar distributions’ such as those
that we found for the words: ‘god’, ‘ye’, ‘thy’, and
‘behold’.
32 http://cran.r-project.org/
33 The twenty-one chapters from the Book of Mormon
that use the same words in the same sequence as
Isaiah or use slightly modified wordings are: 1
Nephi 20 (84% identical to Isaiah 48), 1 Nephi 21
(87% identical to Isaiah 49), 2 Nephi 7 (79% identical
to Isaiah 50), 2 Nephi 8 (93% identical to Isaiah 51),
2 Nephi 12 (86% identical to Isaiah 2), 2 Nephi 13
(94% identical to Isaiah 3), 2 Nephi 14 (95% identical
to Isaiah 4), 2 Nephi 15 (96% identical to Isaiah 5),
2ne16 (96% identical to Isaiah 6), 2 Nephi 17 (98%
identity to Isaiah 7), 2 Nephi 18 (97% identity to
Isaiah 8), 2 Nephi 19 (96% identity to Isaiah 9),
2 Nephi 20 (97% identical to Isaiah 10), 2 Nephi

identical to Isaiah 12), 2 Nephi 23 (94% identity to
Isaiah 13), 2 Nephi 24 (93% identical to Isaiah 14),
Mosiah14 (identical to Isaiah 53), 3 Nephi
22 (identical to Isaiah 54), 3 Nephi 24 (includes
all of Malachi 3), and 3 Nephi 25 (identical to
Malachi 4).
34 Ibid.
35 The thirty-six chapters not conventionally understood
as being derived from Isaiah/Malachi that were
assigned with a probability above 50% to Isaiah/
Malachi are: 2 Nephi 28, 3 Nephi 9, 2 Nephi 26,
2 Nephi 29, 2 Nephi 3, Ether 4, 3 Nephi 21, 2 Nephi
7, 2 Nephi 27, Helaman 13, 2 Nephi 30, 2 Nephi 4,
3 Nephi 30, 3 Nephi 16, 3 Nephi 20, Mosiah 10,
Mosiah 17, Mosiah 20, Jacob 5, Mormon 8, Ether

1 Nephi 2, 1 Nephi 7, Mosiah 24, Helaman 14, Mosiah
3, and 1 Nephi 13.
36 The 2 Nephi 9, 2 Nephi 27, 2 Nephi 28, and 2 Nephi
30 make heavy use of Isaiah’s phraseology, such as
‘Holy One of Israel’ ‘Holy One of Israel’ appears
twenty-seven times in Isaiah, but just five times in
the rest of the Bible. The 2 Nephi 10, 2 Nephi 26,
2 Nephi 27, 2 Nephi 28, 2 Nephi 29, 2 Nephi 30,
Jacob 5, 3 Nephi 20, and 3 Nephi 21 are prophetic
chapters dealing with the theme of restoration and
expounding on Isaiah. Excerpts from Isaiah are
found in 1 Nephi 13, 2 Nephi 26, 2 Nephi 27, 2
Nephi 30, Mosiah 12, 3 Nephi 16, 3 Nephi 20, 3
Nephi 21, and Mormon 8. Verse 20 in 3 Nephi 20
and verse 23 in Mormon 8 both include admonitions
to remember or search the words of Isaiah. The 3
Nephi 14 is a chapter borrowed from the New
Testament (Matthew 7).
37 Ethan Smith was pastor of the Congre-
gationalist Church attended by the family of Oliver
Cowdery.
38 According to the official Mormon Church account,
Smith received the gold plates upon which the
Book of Mormon was inscribed from an angel on
22 September 1827. He is said to have begun his
translation sometime between December 1827 and
February 1828. In mid-June of 1828, the first 116
pages of the document were lost. Shortly after
completing the first 116 pages of the document,
Smith’s scribe Martin Harris took the document
home to show his wife. Stories differ as to whether
the pages were lost, stolen, or destroyed by
Harris’s wife.

literary form. According to Edwards (2004) the pat-
tern of the chiasm found in Alma thirty-six ‘estab-
lishes with 99.98% certainty that this chiasm
occurred in this book by design and rules out the
hypothesis that it occurred by chance’. According to
J. W. Welch (2003), publications in the New England
area describing use of chiasmus as a Biblical literary
form were ‘available for purchase in bookshops or
from traveling salesmen’ in 1825. During that time
period, Oliver Cowdery worked as a traveling sales-
man, selling books and pamphlets (Cowdrey et al.,
2005).
44 According to History of the Church and section eight
of the Doctrine and Covenants (another book of
Mormon scripture), Cowdery attempted to translate
a part of the Book of Mormon, but met with limited
success. Both History of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints and the Doctrine and Covenants are
credited to Smith, but the extent of Smith’s actual
contribution is unknown. Many historical accounts
and revelations attributed to Smith were changed
after-the-fact by others and/or co-produced with
others, including Rigdon and Cowdery.

47 In Bainbridge, Rigdon reportedly became involved in
what appears to be ‘automatic writing’: using a se´ance-
like process to create the Book of Mormon. A descrip-
tion of that process is given in a letter to the editor
titled ‘The Mormon Bible’ which appeared in the New
Northwest on 9 September 1880. The letter reads:
‘We are in receipt of a letter from Mr O. P. Henry,
an Astoria subscriber, who says, in reference to an
article in the Oregonian of recent date concerning
the origin of the Mormon Bible, that his mother,
who is yet alive, lived in the family of Sidney Rigdon
for several years prior to her marriage in 1827; that
there was in the family what is now called a ‘‘writing
medium’’, also several others in adjacent places, and
the Mormon Bible was written by two or three differ-
ent persons by an automatic power which they
believed was inspiration direct from God, the same
as produced the original Jewish Bible and Christian
New Testament. Mr H. believes that Sidney Rigdon
furnished Joseph Smith with these manuscripts, and
that the story of the ‘‘hieroglyphics’’ was a fabrication
to make the credulous take hold of the mystery;
that Rigdon, having learned, beyond a doubt, that
the so-called dead could communicate to the living,
considered himself duly authorized by Jehovah to
found a new church, under a divine guidance similar
to that of Confucius, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed,
Swedenborg, Calvin, Luther or Wesley, all of whom
believed in and taught the ministration of spirits.
The New Northwest gives place to Mr Henry’s
idea as a matter of general interest. The public
will, of course, make its own comments and draw
its own conclusions, See http://www.sidneyrigdon.
com/dbroadhu/NW/miscnw04.htm#081680. Dale
Broadhurst has confirmed several aspects of the
above account, and compiled additional historical
evidence pointing to Bainbridge as the likely loca-
tion for production of the 1827 version of the
Book of Mormon. See http://sidneyrigdon.com/books/
Hnry1942.htm and http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/
books/Brew1945.htm
48 See http://solomonspalding.com/docs/1882PatA.htm
49 Several thematic similarities to the Book of Mormon
have been suggested by Holley (1989), Broadhurst
(http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/) and Chandler
(http://mormonstudies.com/). Tom Donofrio (see
http://www.mormonstudies.com/early1.htm) has
shown that Spalding’s Oberlin Manuscript and The
Book of Mormon both contain phrases borrowed
from David Ramsay (1749–1815), a friend and bio-
grapher of George Washington and author of History
of the American Revolution. They also contain phrases
from Mercy Otis Warren (1728–1814), author of
History of the Rise, Progress and Termination of the
American Revolution (1805). These borrowed phrases
are concentrated in sections on war within the Book
of Alma, where the Spalding signal that NSC detected
is most pronounced (Fig. 9A and B, chapters 138–143
in particular). See: http://www.mormonstudies.
com/early1.htm; http://www.postmormon.org/exp_e/

50 For a description of the Joseph Smith papers project,
see http://www.josephsmithpapers.net
51 Since Van Wagoner’s 1994 biography of Sidney
Rigdon, Mormon history researchers have become
increasingly aware of the pivotal role Rigdon played
in the emergence of Mormonism. Recently, for
example, Reynolds (2005) concluded that Rigdon
was the likely author of ‘The Lectures on Faith’,
a series of seven lectures previously attributed to
Joseph Smith. These lectures played a key role in the
development of early Mormon theology.

Appendix A: Source materials
The Book of Mormon: for analysis, we encoded into
XML an electronic copy of the 1830 text version
of the Book of Mormon obtained from Mr Ronald
Dawbarn and modified to include modern
Mormon chapter divisions. For our version we
excluded book prefaces. A copy of our text can
be found online at http://purl.stanford.edu/
ir:rs276tc2764
Old Testament: because sections of the Book of
Mormon are known to be borrowed or derived
specifically from the Books of Isaiah and
Malachi, we used the entire Book of Isaiah
and the first four chapters from Malachi in the
analysis.
Solomon Spalding: the ‘Oberlin Manuscript’, written
sometime between 1810 and 1812 and published
posthumously in 1910, is the only Spalding
text available today. The handwritten original
is stored in the Mudd Library of Oberlin
College, OH. The manuscript has been referred
to by many names including the ‘Oberlin
Manuscript’, ‘Manuscript Story’, ‘Manuscript
Story–Conneaut Creek’, the ‘Roman Story’,
‘Fabius Story’, ‘Conneaut Story’, and the
‘Honolulu’ manuscript. Our electronic version
of the document was derived from the document
originally published at the Millennial Star office,
Liverpool, England. We include the letter
appended to the Oberlin Manuscript, which is
written in the same hand as the Oberlin manu-
script. Our XML source file was derived from
the HTML version available at http://www.

Sidney Rigdon: an electronic copy of the Book of the
Revelations of Jesus Christ to the Children of Zion
(written in 1864) was provided by Mr David
Marshall who transcribed the hand-written docu-
ment, which is available in Copying Books A & B
of the Stephen Post Collection at the University
of Utah. We removed from this document speci-
fic citations of Old and New Testament scripture
and the revelations to Phebe Rigdon (Sidney
Rigdon’s wife). We also utilized Millenium (pub-
lished December 1833 to May 1835), a collection
of 14 articles published in the newspapers of
the Latter Day Saints. This collection is available
online at http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/RigWrit/

Testament were removed.
Oliver Cowdery: a series of writings from the
Latter Day Saints’ Messenger and Advocate, were

Old and New Testament were removed, as were
other passages not attributable to Cowdery.

Testament were removed from all, as were other
passages not attributable to Pratt. The texts are
