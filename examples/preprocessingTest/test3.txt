Abstract
Immersive multimedia performances, especially in the theater, installation art,
and computer games, suggest to us interesting models for reconceiving the pos-
sibilities of textual editing in digital media. Traditionally, textual editions have
taken different forms for different audiences of readers. Editing protocols, includ-
ing the critical apparatus, are determined in part by those forms. Mostly this has
meant conceiving of a given text as produced for a scholarly, classroom, or
popular audience. However different these types of editions, they share familiar
textual ontologies, developed primarily over the past 200 years and based on
print technology. We suggest instead that editors begin thinking of digital edi-
tions primarily as ‘editorial environments’, with spatial, temporal, procedural,
performative, and participatory properties. An electronic edition is always already
a virtual world. A digital edition is an electronic environment. Citing as an
example our experiment in the MOO with Shelley’s sonnet ‘Ozymandias’, we
imagine the role of the editor as textual ecologist/dramaturge/gamemaster, max-
imizing the resources of digital environments.

This essay was written in 1997. It has not been sig-
nificantly updated but reflects that particular
moment in the debate on electronic text.
The audience watching Tom Stoppard’s The Coast
of Utopia at the National Theatre in summer 2002
found themselves, in effect, immersed in a virtual
reality environment brilliantly designed by William
Dudley to integrate a rotating stage and curved
backdrop screen. Video graphics of a Russian coun-
try house and its grounds, or a wintry Moscow
park and skating rink, were projected and at key
dramatic moments were rotated 3608, sometimes
in coordination with the rotating stage, to produce
kinetic hybrid effects—part physical and part vir-
tual. The overall effect was reminiscent of popular
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century London panor-
amas, multistoried buildings people entered in
order to view paintings in the round, complete
with visual special effects of perspective and light-
ing, and sometimes with live musical accompani-
ment. Like these panoramas, the 3D video
projections for the play were multimedia events;
sometimes in combination with date and place
superimposed in text on the images, the sets
invoked the same kind of cinematic imaginative
immersion produced by certain videogames.
At the same time, in another part of London,
viewers could participate in Chris Hardman’s
Euphorium, an interactive virtual-reality theatrical
production based on Coleridge’s visionary poem,
‘Kubla Khan’.1 Constructed as a maze with ten

interlinked ‘environmental chambers’, this installa-
tion allows one person to enter every three minutes,
wearing a special helmet that projects images in the
space before their eyes, all reflecting parts of the
poem’s text. These images move, combine, and
reshape themselves, accompanied by sound effects,
in a ‘kaleidoscopic’ multimedia experience meant to
embody something of the poem’s hallucinatory lan-
guage in a 3D physical and virtual environment.
Immersive multimedia performance practices of
this kind, especially as they have been developed in
the theater and installation art, as well as exploited
in digital games, suggest to us extremely interesting
possibilities for reconceiving the possibilities of tex-
tual editing in digital media. Traditionally, of
course, textual editions have taken different forms
for different audiences of readers. Editing protocols,
including the critical apparatus, are determined in
part by those forms. Mostly this has meant conceiv-
ing of a given text as produced for a scholarly, class-
room, or popular audience.2 However different
these types of editions may appear on the surface
and may be in substance, they share relatively simi-
lar and quite familiar textual ontologies, developed
primarily over the past 200 years and based on print
technology.
In adapting print editorial paradigms to the digi-
tal medium, notes Susan Schreibman, editors have
largely played the ‘role of assembler of electronic
texts’, becoming ‘on the one hand the literary-
librarian, building a library or the more commonly
termed archive of multimedia objects, and on the
other hand, the literary-encoder grappling with a
logic more amenable to programmers than literary
scholars . . .’. In this situation, the editor is ‘trans-
formed into a hybrid literary-librarian/literary-
encoder whose goal is to create an edition that
surmounts limitations imposed by print-based pub-
lication’.3 The field of electronic textual editing cur-
rently is far more advanced in theorizing and
producing the ‘back end’ of editions—where the
issues primarily involve rigorous structural
markup—than it is in attending to issues relating
to the ‘front end’—the interface through which edi-
tions make their knowledge available experientially
to users. For most editors of poetry, then, the com-
putational and analytical powers of the digital
environment for information archiving and
retrieval have eclipsed its performative and
expressive possibilities, its use as an engine of
representation.
How might editors of electronic editions, partic-
ularly editions of poetry, think and act otherwise?
One way would be to view digital ‘editions’ primar-
ily as ‘editorial environments’, with spatial, tem-
poral, procedural, performative, and participatory
properties.
The fact is that an electronic edition is always
already a virtual world, even when its editors do
not consciously conceive of it in this way, and the
only real question is how relatively rich or impover-
ished an environment it provides. To the role of
editor as librarian/encoder, we would add the
role of the editor as textual ecologist/dramaturge/
gamemaster, maximizing the resources of whatever
editorial environment he or she chooses to work
within—and, increasingly, in digital media those
resources will include image, sound, and video.
At the Romantic Circles Website, we not only
worked with HTML, SGML, and XML encoded edi-
tions in fairly traditional electronic environments,
but we have also experimented with immersive edi-
torial environments in our text-based hybrid
WebMOO, creating editions that are virtual
worlds. For decades now installation artists have
experimented with placing text in physical gallery
or museum spaces, and with using text to create a
sense of space within which the text is reflexively
interpreted, a prototypical form of what we have
come to call ‘immersive textuality’. We would like
to explore the issues raised by textual experiments
in virtual space, particularly the WebMOO, in
which the text is embodied and experienced archi-
tecturally, spatially, at the cognitive intersection
of its linguistic and graphic codes. And we will
conclude with an extended discussion of one such
experimental immersive edition, MOOzymandias,
a WebMOO rendering of Percy Shelley’s sonnet
‘Ozymandias’. Our ultimate interest throughout
is in the ways that an immersive editorial environ-
ment might make possible new forms of textual
editing.
The acronym MOO stands for ‘MUD,
Object-Oriented’—and a MUD is a ‘Multi-User

Dimension (or Dungeon)’, an open-source database
and server program created in 1979 at Essex
University and quickly adapted at places like MIT
and Stanford for communication and the playing of
adventure games among distant university cam-
puses. The first MOO proper, which allowed users
to build and inhabit virtual rooms and objects in an
architectural structure, was developed at the Xerox-
PARC laboratories in 1990 and was quickly repli-
cated around the Internet.4
For our purpose, the salient feature of the MOO
is that it allows for synchronous communication in
shared and mutually constructed virtual spaces. Yet
the MOO—even in multimedia WebMOO form—
remains fundamentally a text-based virtual-reality
environment. As Elizabeth Reid observes, in
MOOs ‘text replaces gesture and has even become
gesture itself’.5 To some degree, rhetoric and com-
position specialists have long appreciated this,6 but
the educational uses of the MOO can be expanded
into the philological and pedagogical practices of
literary studies in general, and of the protocols
and pedagogical uses of scholarly and classroom
editions in particular.
What we might call the MOOer’s illusion—that
willing suspension of disbelief that constitutes MOO
reality—depends on an ongoing process, the recip-
rocal textualization of space and spatialization of
text, so that we experience both written text and
virtual architecture as conditioned by one another
in MOOspace. It is this architectural—what has
been called architextual7—interdependency that
lies behind many of the special pleasures of the
MOO, producing a kind of gaming that is also com-
municating, object manipulation that is also inter-
pretation. This makes the MOO a perfect medium
for what we at Romantic Circles are calling peda-
gogic editions, editorial environments that enable
students to inhabit a poem or novel, engaging
them in the process of arranging texts in order to
interpret them, helping them to recognize the multi-
plicity of versions and the relatively ephemeral, con-
tingent, and constructed nature of those versions,
engaging them in the collaborative material produc-
tion of literary texts. We find a number of salient
parallels and precedents for this construct in the art
world.
Imagine that you find yourself reading the fol-
lowing text:
You open a low wooden door and step into
what appears to the dimly-lit hallway of a
rather shabby apartment building. The hall
extends into the distance, then turns to the
left into darkness. You smell dust and fresh
paint as you look around. As your eyes
adjust to the light provided by a string of
naked bulbs dangling from the ceiling, you
begin to make out a series of panels hung at
eye level running down the length of the hall.
You move in to examine one more closely: it
consists of a page of handwritten text
mounted below an aging photograph of a
Moscow monument. The rough collage has
been framed by someone using yellowed wall-
paper as a matte. Looking closer, you see what
appear to be Russian letters on the wallpaper.
You turn and make your way down the hall.
Rounding a corner, you hear the muffled
sound of a lone voice singing a melancholy
folksong; it seems to be coming from some-
where up ahead . . .
But now, imagine that you are corporeally pre-
sent In Real Life, standing in the physical space of a
large high-ceilinged gallery containing an elaborate
simulation of a Moscow apartment building, a
mixed media installation built like a fragile wasps’
nest inside the cavernous interior of the Tate
Modern in London during summer and fall 2000.
Another, familiar kind of virtual reality, this maze-
like space is a work by Ilya Kabakov, the ‘Father of
Moscow Conceptualism’, titled Labyrinth: My
Mother’s Album. Built by the artist with his wife
and collaborator, Emilia Kabakov, this labyrinthine
space is one part of a massive decade-long larger
project, ‘Monument to a Lost Civilization’ con-
structed serially in museums all over the world.8
In this case, the passages of text arranged in the
labyrinth represent the autobiography of a fictional
Russian woman, a narrative of her own hard life in
the early-to-mid twentieth-century Soviet Union.
Kabakov characterizes this work in literary terms,
as a ‘three-dimensional novel’, or as participating
in the collective narrative conventions of the epic.

Curators tellingly place it in the tradition of
Dostoyevsky, Gogol, and Chekhov. The viewer
encounters the narrative as a series of discrete
wall-mounted image and text collages—hypertex-
tual lexias experienced by physical movement
through architectural space. Clearly a linear if twist-
ing order is suggested by the hallway’s perspective
progression; there are no real forking paths, just the
occasional dead-end doorway in a self-enfolding
spiral. However, one can always stop, skip over, or
read lexias in reverse while navigating the space, can
turn or not turn down the twisting hallway. As you
wind through the installation you hear an a capella
voice singing a Russian folksong; gradually it grows
louder. The source turns out to be a cluttered
closet—what appears to be a janitor’s storeroom—
where you discover building and painting supplies
tossed on the floor. Immersed in the space, you find
yourself piecing together the narrative lexias while
also playing the rather heavily determined game of
finding the source of the voice, a sound like
Ariadne’s thread.
However—and this is what strikes you most of
all—you are also frequently tempted to linger in a
corner, admiring or just experiencing the tactile
reality of chalk lines on the drywall or the half-
swept pile of cigarette butts and candy wrappers
collected with the dust. You bend over and interact
with, touch some of these objects just to prove they
are touchable, really there in front of your face.
Then you return to reading the walls, reading
what is on the walls. Clearly, the artist has arranged
everything according to certain narrative and rhe-
torical or affective assumptions, but the experience
of the space from time-to-time inevitably exceeds
these arrangements. As Kabakov himself has said
in one interview,
installation, as a genre, aspires to anonymity.
I’ve noticed that when people enter a large
and seemingly self-contained installation, the
thought of its authorship never even occurs to
them; that is, the installation is treated as if it
were a construction from an unknown era,
belonging to no country or nation that any-
body knows of. The emotional states experi-
enced by the viewer are directed at anything
but the creator of these objects. . . . 9
Kabakov may be the ‘author’ of the texts on the
walls, but in his role as conceptual architect of the
whole installation he is more like an editor than an
author. In many ways, he is more like a drama-
turge—or gamemaster—than either.
If digital environments are inherently spatial,
procedural, participatory, and performative, these
terms usefully characterize Kabakov’s installation
as well. Most obviously, it is literally spatial, in the
sense that space itself is the primary medium, the
ground of this mixed media work. It can be said to
explore the theme of space and how time and lived
experience can be captured within it. To some
extent the work is also procedural—programmed
like a game by its creator to respond to actions,
within certain parameters, with a certain range of
results. Some of the procedures belong to the fic-
tional persona, whose autobiographical narrative
also shapes the affective responses and moods of
the space. At one point, for instance, you may
find yourself reading a matter-of-fact account of
her abortion, then notice you are standing facing
into a dark corner. Other procedures include the
use of the eerie voice—one may wonder momenta-
rily if it is live or recorded—that guides you to the
janitor’s closet full of construction supplies and its
implied self-reflexive metaphor for the artist’s role.
This kind of installation is obviously participa-
tory and performative—one must inhabit and walk
through it to experience it. Participants willingly
immerse themselves in the fictional construct, play-
ing along. The walls and lighting, supplemented by
the text and images, become, in Janet Murray’s
terms, the ‘boundary conventions that allow us to
surrender to the enticements’10 of the space, calling
on the viewer to walk and read and touch—to
become an engaged interactor performing the
theatrical possibilities of the virtual building in an
imaginary Moscow. And because the installation is
also a social space, one’s performance of the text
is always contingent upon the actions of others
inhabiting and performing the same text at the
same time.
Installation artists have always experimented
with the textuality of space and spatial qualities
of text. One of the best known examples is
Jenny Holzer, whose most famous works employ

dynamic scrolling LED marquees to make discrete
experiential spaces out on the public streets of cities,
such as San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, or
London, or in galleries such as the Guggenheim.
These electronic signs are built with the collabora-
tion of an engineer and set to scroll and loop texts—
especially truisms or fragmentary, banal or oracular
utterances. In the 1980s Holzer experimented with
TV and in the 1990s with digital media, including
headset-mediated VR exhibits and the Web itself
(‘please change beliefs’), a logical extension of her
interest in text-defining space and space-defining
text.11
But Holzer is just one well-known example.
Michael Heim and others have anatomized and
explored immersive spaces, from experimental
installation art, to the Xerox PARC experiment in
the future of reading called ‘Walk-in Comix’, where
the walls are panels and pages, or to the room-sized
surround-screen, surround-sound projective envi-
ronment of the CAVE, for example, created at
the Electronic Visualization Laboratory of the
University of Illinois, Chicago.
As described by Heim, the CAVE
immerses participants by projecting 3-D com-
puter graphics into a ten-foot square cube
composed of display screens that completely
surround the viewers. It tracks head and hand
movements to produce the correct stereo
perspective.. . . A sound system provides
audio feedback. The viewer explores the vir-
tual world by moving around inside the cube
and grabbing objects with a three-button,
wand-like device. Instead of wearing helmets
to experience a virtual world, CAVE dwellers
put on lightweight stereo glasses and walk
around inside the CAVE as they interact
with virtual objects. Multiple viewers can
share the same virtual experience and can
easily carry on conversations inside the
CAVE, enabling researchers to exchange dis-
coveries and ideas. . . . (p. 26, 27)
Although the CAVE was created as a tool for
extremely high-end scientific visualizations, as a
model it could bring a whole new meaning to the
phrase ‘getting into a text’.
Indeed, Robert Coover and a group of creative
writers are already experimenting in this direction
at Brown University’s virtual-reality chamber. An
article in the New York Times for 19 August 2002
describes these experiments as ‘another step in elec-
tronic writing’s evolution from a set of digitally
interconnected words and sentences to an envelop-
ing experience that augments the text with sound,
video and nearly tangible 3-D imagery’. As the article
explains, viewers entering the VR chamber don
stereoscopic glasses through which computer gener-
ated texts on the wall appears in three dimensions:
‘Viewers can watch as words materialize and swirl
through the air around them, or they can step into a
rotating cube to see an E. E. Cummings quotation
that has been digitally inscribed on two of the walls.’
Text on the walls can be generated on the fly through
a text-painting program that allows the mouse to act
as an airbrush nozzle ‘spraying strings of letters
around the room.. . . After the letters appear in
space, they form words that hang in midair’, encir-
cling the viewer. In one 3D short story, words on the
wall peel away as they are clicked on by a mouse,
floating through the air and returning into the text in
random places, changing the meaning of a sentence,
or making nonsense of it. Such experiments suggest
that we will one day see literary VR theaters, for
example, in which Shelley or Joyce scholars make
and share discoveries about the text while inside of
Prometheus Unbound or Ulysses. Our own experi-
ment with MOOzymandias—a new kind of ‘peda-
gogical edition’ that students can build, mutate, and
inhabit—takes an interesting step in this direction,
as we will soon demonstrate.
Virtual Reality and immersive digital games—
including MUDs and MOOs, as well as later graphi-
cally intense first person shooters and multiplayer
role-playing games, such as Halo or Word of
Warcraft—and art-world experiments, such as
Holzer’s and Kabakov’s grew up together in the
1980s and 1990s and have always arguably ‘interme-
diated’ one another—to adapt Jay David Bolter and
Richard Grusin’s term, ‘remediation’, for this kind
of relationship.12 Many installation artworks, like
electronic games, are about ‘virtual reality’—in
more than one sense. But, then, so are imaginative
literary works.

Moreover, the historically dominant physique
and technique of literary works, the technology of
the codex book, is fundamentally a spatial matter. In
literary studies, a scholarly editor working in the
letterpress medium to produce a book must con-
ceive of the text spatially, to some extent, and cer-
tainly, as Jerome McGann has argued, must
conceive of it physically.13 For editors, literary
works are always materially embodied and disposed,
mediated by the bibliographic codes of the book as
much as by the formal and semantic features of the
text. Page layout, typeface, editorial apparatus of
whatever extent are all part of the conscious
arrangement and embodiment that makes an edi-
tion—almost always in collaboration with others,
from research assistants to co-editors, to designers,
to publishers, and marketers. Indeed, the immersive
features of digital environments throw into clear
relief the nascent immersive features of traditional
textual editions themselves, which are philological
in their instrumentality and phenomenological in
their effects. Readers perform the procedures
encoded within the structure or physique of a tex-
tual edition—and to that extent participate in its
very realization—becoming ‘immersed’ by the inter-
play of text and apparatus within the ‘depths’ of the
edition. In this sense, every edition and literary work
is, more or less, immersive—as are Renaissance
fairs, for example, or theme parks, children’s
games, rituals, and performance spaces.14 We are
specifically interested in the strong form of immer-
sive environment that often characterizes gaming
under the special protocols of digital environments.
An active gamer helps to sustain and shape the
fictional world of play at the same time that he or
she is responding to other players and the pro-
grammed conventions and procedures of that
world. Our pedagogical editions in the Romantic
Circles MOO are derived in part from the discourse
of game theory and share with games the feature of
inhabitable virtual space—a feature whose geneal-
ogy does not descend from philology (as do tradi-
tional scholarly editions) so much as from the
conventions and protocols of museums and
galleries.
On the simplest level, catalog commentary, often
mounted on walls beside art objects, sharing and
co-constructing space with the object itself, has
always been an integral part of the viewer’s experi-
ence of the work of art in museums. But there have
been more extreme experiments in museum
interfaces.
On a recent visit to Seattle, we spent a day in
Frank Gehry’s stunning tourist attraction, the
Experience Music Project, a kind of public temple
of rock’n roll, with Jimi Hendrix at the holy of
holies but including niches dedicated to skatepunk,
ska, and of course, this being Seattle, grunge.
The building itself inspired by laquered electric
guitar bodies, provides a disorienting immersive
environment ultimately descended from Filmore
lightshows and their predecessors, the warehouse
acid tests of the 1960s. Once inside we were invited
to become what science fiction writer Neal
Stephenson (in his paradigmatic 1992 novel, Snow
Crash) has satirically called gargoyles, geeks wearing
their computing equipment out in public, each of us
made into a hybridized cyborg carrying a digital
shoulder-bag pack, headphones, and handheld
infrared device. After a brief training session, we
were set loose in the museum space. The gargoyle
pack allowed us to point, click, listen, and generally
interact with the otherwise fairly conventional dis-
play cases of artifacts and commentary in text panels
or on video screens.
Looking at a display-mounted leather biker
jacket once worn by Elvis, we could hear not only
a recording of ‘Don’t be Cruel’ but commentary
on subcultures, fashion, and Marlon Brando.
Bookmarking the object with our handheld device
allowed us to construct as we went a personalized
Web page on the EMP server that we could turn to
later in order to drill deeper for more text and music
files.
At first it may seem that the idea of this interface
is to interiorize the museum-going experience, iso-
lating each individual gargoyle in an out-of-body
trip through the hallucinatory dreamspace Gehry
has designed. But in fact it is more complicated
than that. We could always hear each other and
other museum-goers talking beside us, as well as
ambient noise in the building and music and
video soundtracks further along the exhibit cases.
We frequently stopped, removed our headphones,

and discussed what we were seeing and hearing. In
fact, the gargoyle experience of the EMP was more
like another science fictional device, the special digi-
tal data glasses of William Gibson’s Virtual Light
(1993), which superimpose textual and iconic inter-
pretations in a constant mediating foreground on
whatever one sees in the physical environment, tall
buildings, public squares, abandoned bridges (or, it
is impossible to avoid noting in these troubled
times, like the real head-mounted displays that
create data interfaces for today’s military weapons,
from the Gulf War to Afghanistan). Admitting that
no museum object can be experienced directly, in
unmediated fashion, the EMP goes to extremes to
create a kind of self-consciously hypermediated per-
spectivism, a live interface of multiple and shifting
layers.
In fact, a number of current theoretical argu-
ments within the museum community over the
meaning of ‘museum experience’ are illuminating
for the purposes of our experiments with immersive
editorial environments in the MOO, especially the
debate over whether museums ought to be ‘object
centered’ or ‘story centered’.15 On the one hand, this
distinction parallels the historical difference between
editions that are text centered and those that are
commentary centered; and, on the other hand, it
suggests that the commentary or contextual material
itself might take the form of a story, or even, a game,
replacing the traditional apparatus criticus with a
virtual world. Story-centered or gamelike presenta-
tions highlight the object as a site of unfolding
experience rather than as hermetically sealed, and
lend themselves especially to digital environments.
Take, for example, Jerome McGann and Johanna
Drucker’s experimental Ivanhoe Game, which
exploits the theatrical possibilities of digital envi-
ronments to create a space in which students are
able, in effect, to perform Scott’s novel—making
individual critical decisions that change a collective
database that is the story-world of the whole.16 For
McGann and Drucker, ‘Humanities scholarship
without gameplay, even when the scholarship expli-
citly devotes itself to self-reflection, inevitably fails
to engage with essential features of the works it
means to study, including the workings of the
mind engaged with such works.’
The Ivanhoe Game, touches upon another feature
of strong immersive environments: their ability self-
reflexively to model processes of textual reproduc-
tion and critical engagement. Like the installation
art we have discussed and, indeed, museum space
in general, MOOspace can display what Hilde S.
Hein in The Museum in Transition calls ‘participa-
tory exhibitry’ (p. 49), work in progress that pro-
vides a metacommentary upon the scenes of its own
production, partly by inviting the viewer to become
an active doer, for example, as our gargoyle equip-
ment involved us in the Experience Music Project.
Such exhibitry can become a means, in Heins’s
words, of ‘fostering and investigating the collabora-
tive process itself’. Hein asks, ‘How does one give
visible form to the excitement of an intellectual
process?. . . Just as museums seek to inspire . . . a
common responsive experience . . . they might suc-
ceed, with the help of scholars, in designing ways to
activate a collaborative cognitive capacity poten-
tially present in everyone.’ (p. 49)
What might it mean, then, to produce a textual
edition that seeks through a form of immersive ‘par-
ticipatory exhibitry’ to engage the ‘collaborative
cognitive capacity’ of its users, one that instead of
appearing as a finished product, provides a proce-
dural, dialogical, and explicitly gamelike editorial
environment through which readers can be trans-
formed into players and collaborative editors of a
shared textual space, constructing new editorial
content and reflecting upon the processes through
which that content is produced? What might it
mean to construct a textual edition that can itself
embody a virtual community?
That is the nature of the experiment we
have embarked upon in MOOspace, in the develop-
ment of one prototypical pedagogical edition,
MOOzymandias.17 Dedicated to Shelley’s sonnet,
‘Ozymandias’, the textual space of MOOzymandias
was conceived as a labyrinthine tomb. Something
between a virtual museum installation and an edi-
tion in three imagined dimensions, the project uses
Shelley’s verbal text as participatory exhibitry,
building material to be arranged, explored, and
reconstructed. A series of linked chambers echo
the poem’s multiply-framed points of view: from
the speaker to the ‘traveler from an antique land’

to the sculptor to the king himself. One progresses
inwards through the structure of the sonnet, and
bits of the text are gradually revealed at each level,
always in procedural response to user interactions.
But the MOO makes possible other useful fictions,
such as the transformation of keywords from the
text into programmable MOO objects, to be pro-
grammed to respond in various inventive ways and
placed in each chamber where new users encounter
them.
There are other objects beyond the keywords:
intertextual, paratextual, and contextual furniture
that offer a range of interactive possibilities. Some
are Turing bots—agents with modest artificial intel-
ligence who respond to users questions with pro-
grammed simulated conversation. And some
special objects throughout the space are pro-
grammed to teleport users to and through a net-
work of primarily user-built tunnels and rooms,
each of which contains thematized objects that
explore not just the poem’s, but the
MOOzymandias edition’s literary, cultural, or his-
torical contexts, including two recently built by a
group of graduate students at the University of
Maryland—one on Romantic Orientalism and
visual culture, and one on MOO exhibitry as a
form of ekphrasis—and a series of ‘Formal Suites’
built by undergraduates at Loyola University
Chicago to explore by architectural analogy the
structure of ‘Ozymandias’.
The user only learns what the different kinds of
objects do by constructively interacting with them.
For example, in the entryway or antechamber you
encounter a ‘book’ that when ‘opened’ (one types
the command ‘open book’) moves your virtual
character to an entirely new room. From this, the
first of the nested chambers of the tomb, one key
object takes you down to a heretofore hidden series
of linked tunnels running beneath the chambers. By
now you know enough to be on the alert for tele-
portation objects, but along the way, the gamelike
features of the environment, including an experi-
mental collection of multimedia effects—from an
ambient musical soundtrack and other audio files,
to Quicktime VR and Flash movies—appear in the
space to be manipulated, explored, and interpreted.
The overall result is a sense of having literalized,
spatialized the architecture of Shelley’s poem, of
inhabiting and discovering not just the verbal text
of the sonnet but a series of objects and spaces, on
more than one level, suggestive of several complex
overlapping contexts. In this way, the structure and
context for Shelley’s poem is at once historicized
and materialized in the virtual objects, while the
illusion of the fictional space you are in is
reinforced.
At the heart of the maze is the part of
MOOzymandias that most closely resembles the
content of traditional textual editions, a Regency
parlor in which the textual history of ‘Ozymandias’
constitutes the furnishing objects, a virtual form of
editorial versioning. You open a heavy wooden door
and seem to be transported through time and space
to a well-furnished parlor in early nineteenth century
London. It is fully furnished, decorated in the
‘Etruscan’ style, more proof of the fashion for all
things antique:
You see a life-sized sarcophagus along the far
wall. A small bust of Napoleon shares space
with many books tossed on the cluttered
bookcase. No one is home but you see signs
of recent occupation: the embers of a fire are
glowing in the fireplace and a half-empty glass
of wine and two newspapers are on the table
beside the couch. On a small desk in the
corner, a stack of papers is held down by a
miniature stone pyramid; beside the papers is
an inkwell with a tall quill pen.
Here, users will be able to find in the bookcase a
manuscript notebook that contains Shelley’s draft
and fair copy of ‘Ozymandias’; a copy of Shelley’s
Rosalind and Helen volume, including the first ver-
sion of the poem to be published under his real
name; a chapbook on sonnet structure, including
instructions on how to write a sonnet; a pamphlet
on the Regency fad of sonnet competitions, during
one of which ‘Ozymandias’ was composed, along
with an invitation for users to supply their own
entry into the ‘Ozymandias’ competition; and a
copy of the DNB, with a biography of Horace
Smith, the friend with whom Shelley was competing.
The two newspapers on the table are copies of Leigh
Hunt’s Examiner, the first containing the original

appearance in print of Shelley’s sonnet, under the
pseudonym ‘Gilrastes’; the second, Horace Smith’s
sonnet on Ozymandias, written in competition with
Shelley, and published by Hunt shortly after
Shelley’s. And those adventurous enough to open
the sarcophagus will find a copy of ‘Address to a
Mummy’, the most popular poem Horace Smith
ever wrote:
And hast thou walk’d about, (how strange a
story!)
In Thebes’s streets three thousand years ago,
When the Memnonium was in all its glory,
And time had not begun to overthrow
Those temples, palaces, and piles stupendous,
Of which the very ruins are tremendous.
Speak! for thou long enough hast acted
Dummy.
Thou hast a tongue—-come—-let us hear its
tune;
Thou’rt standing on thy legs, above-ground,
Mummy! . . .
The most exciting thing about the WebMOO
environment as a platform for this project is
that it is a networked, social space, accessible at all
times to multiple users logged in from anywhere
in the world. Best of all, it is open-ended and con-
structible. Students around the country (or the
world) can create their own MOOzymandias
objects on the fly—perhaps in dialectical response
to an existing object, can even dig their own
tunnel in the maze. The result is a rhizomatic net-
work of participatory spaces that are all part of the
pedagogic edition as it continues to grow and
mutate.
All tunnels ultimately connect to the backbone
structure we have designed, and thus all tunnels may
eventually wind their way to the final chamber, in
which an Egyptian Sphinxbot’s questions about
‘Ozymandias’ have to be answered before you can
leave the tomb to emerge on the level sands of the
desert above. Once in the desert, you can don a pair
of sunglasses that allow for a full view of the text of
Shelley’s poem, as critically edited by us, shimmer-
ing like a mirage in your field of vision.
If you have made it this far though the
MOOzymandias maze, you are permitted a
dramatic endgame exit, through and beyond the
text as it were: the hot air balloon carries you into
the sky, a bird’s eye perspective looking down on the
MOO as a whole. From here one can go down to
anywhere in this virtual world. Of course that
includes other pedagogic editions, under construc-
tion elsewhere in the MOO; for instance, the
FrankenMOO project being built by students at
Georgia Tech under the direction of Ron Broglio,
one of Romantic Circles’ Associate Editors.
These pedagogic editorial environments are per-
haps ‘editions’ only in the conceptually expanded
sense we have been exploring, but that is precisely
the point: to try to expand what we mean by—and
more important—what we do with textual editions.
We believe that computer-mediated editorial envir-
onments offer intriguing possibilities for editions of
all kinds as they come, in the fullness of time, to
inhabit multimedia digital forms that will exploit as
editorial resources not only just the printed word,
but also images, sound, video, interactivity, and,
even perhaps, those literary Virtual Reality
Theaters we discussed above—as well as other
kinds of editorial environments yet to be imagined.

in Narrative as Virtual Reality: Immersion and
Interactivity in Literature and Electronic Media.
Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 20.
For Ryan there are three distinct kinds of immersion:
spatial, temporal, and emotional, all of which she sees
ultimately as functions of narrative: a text is immers-
ive only if it creates ‘a space to which the reader,
spectator, or user can relate, and it must populate
this space with individuated objects. It must, in
other words, construct the setting for a potential nar-
rative action, even though it may lack the temporal
extension to develop this action into a plot’
(pp. 14–15). We are much less interested than Ryan
in the ways that readers get lost or absorbed in an
immersive text than in the possibilities immersive
texts provide for self-reflexively modeling critical
engagement with texts and textuality.
