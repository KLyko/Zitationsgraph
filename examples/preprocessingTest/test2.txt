The Other Side of  the Panopticon: Technology, Archives, and the Difficulty of  
Seeing Victorian Heterotopias

Abstract
Can digital methods resolve major debates in the historiography of  political agency? In recent 
decades, historical scholarship in British politics has identified an era of  expert rule at the cost of  
seemingly losing the thread of  successful movements from below after 1815. The talk will outline 
the failures of  the linguistic turn and the subsequent return of  British social history back to the 
state. An emerging consensus now describes an era of  modern expert rule characterized by the 
state’s presence in every domain of  everyday life, including infrastructure, public health, crime, 
poverty, and housing. Historians in this tradition routinely describe Britain 1848 as a nation where 
the subaltern features chiefly as the subject of  surveillance, management, and repression. Much 
more rarely do these stories successfully describe subalterns after 1848 as political actors in their 
own right. Political historians are thus challenged by questions first raised by Karl Polanyi, Michel 
Foucault, and Jurgen Habermas. Is the hegemonic power of  the state in the modern world 
complete? Where can one find evidence of  structural or continuous resistance? Successfully 
identifying agency from below demands a redefinition of  political agency and new methodologies 
for sorting the masses of  texts opened up for mining by the digital era. Such questions require us to 
excavate methodologies from late nineteenth-century philosophers of  language like Ernst Cassirer, 
mid-century geographers like Peter Gould, scholars of  mobile structure like E. J. Hobsbawn, and 
anarchist writers like Colin Ward. These methods, I shall argue, foreground the potential of  language 
mining for identifying spaces of  emergent publics where agency from below has been expressed 
over the long duree.
Applied to digital texts, landscape methods can enhance the depth and breadth of  research on 
alternative agency. A program for digital research is presented, together with a database on the 
heterotopias of  late nineteenth-century London, designed to highlight the spatiality of  state 
surveillance, the land reform movement, theosophists, slumming, sexual and ethnic subcultures, 
bohemia, and hobohemia. Preliminary maps of  places named in the database will be presented in 
conjunction with a discussion of  how such a method might address larger historiographical 
concerns.
Introduction
Can digital methods solve major crises in the historiography of  political agency? In the grand cross-
fertilization of  computer science and the humanities, a premium on visualization and experiment has 
been less useful to historians than to disciplines like literature and folklore where the success of  new 
work depends principally upon pattern-finding alone.
Historians are different. Any unique cultural pattern or economic event may be utterly meaningless 
in the light of  further historical research. What matters in history is showing change over time; what 
matters to the individual historian is contributing to a collective understanding of  the chronology of 
events and offering some new insights about the relationship of  evidence to historical consensus.

Such revolutions in historical thinking tend to capitalize on at least one of  two basic styles of  
innovation. The first is a historiographical revision that reframes our understanding of  an era, for 
instance showing that a so-called epoch of  laissez-faire actually demonstrated the hand of  
government throughout. The second is a methodological innovation, which may involve the 
discovery of  a new archive (for instance, previously unutilized town archives showing the process of 
nationalist thinking through the countryside), or the use of  new materials previously unconsidered 
as archival materials, for instance the reading of  ballads and fairytales as sources for peasant 
mentality.
Both of  these problems—asking new questions of  old sources and finding new sources—are all the 
more difficult in an overwritten literature like that of  British political history, where two hundred 
years of  social, political, and economic history have critiqued and dismantled seemingly infinitesimal 
questions of  party, diet, wealth, and radicalism. The stakes of  playing the game are therefore very 
high, and the meaningful questions already negotiated. Merely showing something beautiful with 
sources is insufficient to persuade historians of  its use: rather, the competent marshaling of  large 
numbers of  documents becomes essential.
Postmarxism’s Mandate to History
For political historians of  my generation, there is perhaps no more central problem than the issue of 
vanishing agency from below. The origins of  this problem date from the revisions offered by 
midcentury social history, when E. P. Thompson and others applied the new methods of  structural 
analysis to working-class politics, using ballads and pamphlets as texts. By the 1970s and 80s, these 
methods, now routine, were applied to radical Chartism and working-class music halls, where social 
historians discerned the remnants of  radical traditions, surviving even amidst the suppression of  
political difference from above.1
Yet something was wrong with this story. Anyone who came of  age in Britain in the era of  the 
Nationality Act of  1982 and the Brixton Riots of  1985 was struck not with the success of  British 
radical idealism but rather its violent suppression. According to leftist historians like Gareth 
Stedman Jones, the most stunning historical fact about Thatcher was the absence of  a working-class 
critique of  these issues. British working-class radicalism, rather than challenging local government 
and eventually being absorbed into a class-friendly welfare state (as Sydney and Beatrice Webb had 
prophesied from the 1920s), had in fact been crushed by the disciplinary functions of  the welfare 
state, with its stunning success at stifling Irish and working-class dissent. Gareth Stedman Jones 
forwarded the depressing conjecture that this tradition of  state suppression meant that working-class 
politics had become meaningless in his own day.2

Remaking of  a Working Class,” Journal of  Social History 7, no. 4 (Summer 1974): 460-508. On the Brixton Riots and their 
suppression: Ian Baucom, Out of  Place: Englishness, Empire, and the Locations of  Identity (Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 1999) and Dick Hebdige, Hiding in the Light: On Images and Things (London: Routledge, 1988).
The result was a full-scale realignment of  historical interest away from the thick description of  
working-class culture and towards a history of  the state, state surveillance, and state suppression of  
political dissent. By the 1990s, their efforts, regarded now as the British version of  the “linguistic 
turn,” were revealing not Thompson’s triumphant account of  a working class in the make, but rather 
the grim triumph of  the state over an oral culture of  constitutionality, family, and locality, too often 
co-opted by local administrators and official language.3
This new set of  concerns provoked a shift of  attention from every-day languages to official ones. 
Under the influence of  Foucault, post-Marxism defined how an expanding logic of  expertise had 
operated through public health acts, contagious disease acts, schools, council housing, the 
mechanisms of  abstraction and assortment, control-isolated women and minorities, and the poor for 
special surveillance. Historians learned to read maps for the traces of  state surveillance; they pillaged 
the papers of  parliament for the evangelical prejudices of  inspectors and social reformers, and they 
added great heaps of  new primary sources to the canon of  historical argumentation.4
The result was a new consensus about the rise and progress of  the state stamped with a new 
pessimism about political agency from below. As James Vernon summarized the work of  a decade, 
“the mid-Victorian language of  popular politics” had increasingly defined “the poor, the sick, the 
residuum, the ethnic ‘Other’... as objects of  sociological study” thus denying them “a sense of  
themselves as acting political subjects.”5 The work of  the last three decades in British history—my 
own concluded—has exhumed the story of  the state’s reach and the bootlessness of  struggle from 
below. Favoring anecdotes about the representation of  the state, it has eschewed local experience 
and alternative cultures as having left any mark on the grand sweep of  history.
Very rarely do British historians admit candidly what a dark story we have been telling. For our 
current consensus suggests that the only form of  agency that matters is that which defines 
participation in the nation, and that just this form of  agency is impossible in the modern era. The 
one point upon which we all agree—we historians of  bureaucracy, state surveillance, infrastructure, 
and post-colonialism—is the lack of  agency of  the poor over their own destiny in the modern era.
This, then, is the problem I have summarized as the question of  vanishing of  agency from below. 
After 1848, did no minority have control over their own destiny?

History 19, no. 1 (January 1994): 81-97. 
Now, important questions about the pervasiveness of  control in the modern era have been raised 
from outside the discipline of  history. Geographers such as David Harvey and Miles Ogborn have 
theorized that both capital and liberalism had geographic limits characterized by “spaces of  
resistance” or “heterotopias.” The latter term, initially a phrase of  medical practice, was borrowed by 
Foucault to describe the sites where radical practice emerged, and developed by Michel de Certeau as 
a method for studying the social practices of  the politically oppressed.6 In the hands of  historical 
geographers, investment in political resistance from below turned scholarly attention to the 
heterotopias where alternative politics emerged, however briefly, in the history of  the state’s rise to 
power. In such spaces—for instance the coffeehouse, barricade, or back-to-the-land movement—the 
state’s influence was limited and forms of  working-class self-organization existed that seem to 
describe an alternative turn within history.
Such conjectures have enticed a range of  historians grappling with the chronology of  political 
agency. James Epstein and Simon Gunn presented the geographers’ theory to historians, raising the 
possibility of  discerning physical sites like coffee houses and working-class meetings where politics 
was contested in practice. Numerous studies document the expansion of  cartography from 
eighteenth-century military and naval surveying into disease control, crime, and poverty, they 
explained. They advocated a fuller inquiry into spatial agency, simultaneously from below and from 
above, using landscape as the lens by which to deconstruct the omnipotence of  state agency in the 
modern era.7
Such a systematic analysis is not easily come by. The “spatial turn” has rather documented, 
piecemeal, micro-histories of  neighborhood and representation. Studies of  resistance concentrate 
on the making of  identity on East-end streets, of  the nature of  the Jewish East End and the 
spatiality of  Tamil nationalism. They tend to illustrate the diversity of  possible ways of  life in late 
nineteenth-century Britain, but none synthesized anything like a systematic view of  agency in 
relationship to the state.8
The challenge for historians is to demonstrate the breadth and continuity of  such alternative spaces. 
A single Fourierist settlement or Theosophist movement does little to challenge the dominance of  
nineteenth-century industrialization, surveillance, and repression. But utopias beget other utopias; 
working-class music more working-class music. In number and diversity, these alternative 
movements comprise the other side of  modernity, and they are just as much a reality of  life in the 
modern nation as panopticism. Conducting a survey of  this depth and creativity requires new

methods. Rarely have historians managed the consistency and tenacity to conduct a broad-range 
survey of  alternative modern developments.
We have then the seed, but not the systematic analysis, of  a history of  freedom in the modern era. 
What would be needed to persuasively prove the historical existence of  alternatives to panoptical 
modernity would be a continuous, systematic analysis of  cultural space that allowed the juxtaposition 
of  power from above with alternatives from below. 
Critical Theory Offers a Strategy
I began by asserting that major revisions in historical narrative depend upon two forms of  revision: 
an accumulation of  new sources and the application of  new questions to those sources. When we 
describe the dialectics that characterize thinking about political agency in modern Britain, we look 
back over an expanding set of  sources—the songs and ballads of  working-class experience, the 
maps and official papers of  the state, and the documents of  nineteenth-century social reformers—
each new expansion in the archive driven by the ideal of  historical revision pushing forward the 
history of  agency in some new way.9 Is it possible, then that the “spatial turn” would be driven by 
just such a methodological expansion in the digital humanities?
Digital humanities promise just such enhanced archives for the purposes of  research. The search for 
agency from below demands new methodologies and a redefinition of  political agency based upon 
different categories of  evidence.
Faced with the context of  the “spatial turn,” two methods in the digital humanities are particularly 
relevant: First, the individual researcher’s expanding scale of  access to texts, and second, the 
researcher’s enhanced abilities to analyze the role of  space in human societies. What historians need 
is the blending of  these two resources—synthetic searches across mass digitized archives, and spatial 
analytics on the databases thereby created—to make real contributions to ongoing conversations 
about the life of  political agency.

These assertions about the role of  digital history come out of  my own experience in the stacks. Like 
all dissertation-writing graduate students, I went to the archives; but midway through my project, I 
began to realize that the very parliamentary debates upon which my work focused were more 
available online than off. As my work became more centered upon digital repositories, inscape 
became an avenue for raising questions about the meaning of  digital databases for historians in 
particular.
Most important among these expanding horizons was the possibility of  synthetic search. In 2007-8 
Google Book Search launched, introducing the possibility of  keyword searching mass digitized 
databases not merely in the constrained, subject-limited sense of  an ECCO or EEBO, but across 
fields and over centuries. Keyword searching, by allowing scholars to sort through larger numbers of 
texts for the mention of  trace events, settings, figures, or practices, allows the historian to propose 
longer questions, bigger question. That suggests the shifting of  graduate dissertations from five 
years of  parliamentary reports to 500 years of  text. From 2004, I kept a blog named ‘inscape,’ where 
I routinely discussed my dissertation research, and I began to document the way mass keyword 
searching was allowing me to extend my archival project on the history of  surveying to tell a 125-
year history of  the British road network and its engineers, administrators, and travelers.10 
Yet around the same time, scholars in archaeology, anthropology, and literature began to press the 
internet’s ability to perform spatial analytics on large data sets. Because place names are frequently 
unique spatial identifiers, digital scholars have been able to analyze historical events on a spatial level, 
identifying new geographical alignments. Just this sort of  pattern-finding has been marshaled by the 
geospatial scholars at the Scholars’ Lab in the service of  the Tibetan and Himalayan Library, 
allowing archaeologists and scholars of  religion to work together to discern patterns in geography, 
religion, and politics. Similar projects have proved how the spatial analysis of  traditional databases 
may act as a spur to further research.11 
The application of  such work to historiographical questions—not to say historical datasets, but 
rather the problem of  historical revisionism—is not entirely straightforward. Yet in the context of  
the “spatial turn,” historians have a new opportunity to contemplate the imbedded questions of  
center and periphery, borderland and boundary within deeply traditional discussions in history. 
Consider, for instance, the historiography of  the Industrial Revolution. Spatial analytics of  the 
railways raise questions about the creation of  new, isolated peripheries within Britain. In 2009, I 
began mapping those places not visited by the rail in 1847 as a key to raising further questions about 
the boundaries between inclusion and exclusion in advancing industrialization.12 Basic questions like 
this one may give way to more imaginative question about the role of  borderlands in the 
composition of  British nationality. In 2010, I mapped the places that registered as “crumbling cities” 
in the imagination of  writers in the “long depression” of  the 1870s. They mention the declining 
industrial towns of  the north of  Britain, as well as the new ghost towns left behind by collapsing rail

lines in the American West, but they also mention the ruined cities of  India, Egypt, and Persia—
evidence of  an imaginary landscape by which the possible decline of  empire was being measured.13 
These tools do not lend themselves to every debate equally. Mass search and spatial analytics share a 
particular homology with questions of  change over time and the creation of  imagined communities
—issues at the heart of  historical study over the last two hundred years. Expanding archives and 
spatial analytics are thus perhaps the two tools best suited to the work of  the historian writing in the 
face of  a canonical tradition. 
But it is the scale and power these tools allow the individual researcher that should cause historians 
to pay the most attention. Synthetic analysis over broad periods of  time and spatial comparison gives 
the individual historian, faced with a tradition, the possibility of  engaging a literature as rich as that 
of  British political history with a database rivaling those that took Raymond Williams and E.P. 
Thompson decades to assemble. By mere dint of  scale, such digital methods put the young historian 
in a position to raise a major critique of  historiographical problems. Where digital methods 
correspond with historiographical critique, they raise the young scholar to an equal playing field with 
the tweed-jacketed dons and silver-haired radicals who have ingested hundreds of  texts over the 
course of  a lifetime. Such an expansion of  access and malleability is unprecedented in the history of 
history. It reduces the barriers of  archival travel, tabulation, and data collection that previously 
separated the leisured ivy-league scholar from his colleague at the distant university. It grants to 
young scholars—with potentially revolutionary ideas outside of  the historical question—the tools to 
break open historical canons not merely on the decade scale but also on the scale of  centuries. 
These stakes are serious enough that the methodology of  handling such large amounts of  data must 
be taken with extreme care. This means, of  course, not reading texts out of  context; sufficient 
biographical study on the authors and agents involved, and due recourse to secondary sources and 
the historiographical canon. For the purposes of  a history of  heterotopias, methods may be refined 
even further. We can even further qualify the kinds of  methods best suited to the study of  political 
agency by returning to late nineteenth-century anthropology. 
The first of  these methods is attention to the logic of  place-making as a cultural practice. The need 
for such a history was first proposed by Thomas Carlyle, who in 1837 urged that only a radical 
history of  perception and identity was capable of  explaining events so dramatic as the French 
Revolution. Carlyle impressed upon nineteenth-century historians the necessity of  writing a history 
of  the imagination, urging that the “world” of  the modern era was “not fixable” but rather 
fabricated from fictions, even “the very Rocks and Rivers” being re-sculpted by “inward sense.”14 
Under Carlyle’s influence, nineteenth-century historians as venerable as Thomas Macaulay devoted

sociability.15
The study of  place-making was only refined into a science in the hands of  late nineteenth-century 
anthropology. In 1893, a young Harvard graduate student, Franz Boas, was investigating the 
Kwakiutl, a “sea-faring people to whom the forms of  land and water and the dangers of  the sea are 
all-important.”16 They oriented themselves, he found, according to the direction of  the coastline and 
rivers. By writing down each place name and each constitutive category of  place, Basso created a 
language-map that allowed him to reach generalizations about Kwakiutl foodways, settlement 
patterns, and even cultural values. Their language had “innumerable terms for islands,” including 
“island at the foot of  a mountain,” and “island in the neck of  a river,” the latter of  which could 
serve as a metaphor for an impediment in an argument or a marriage. Locations could be described 
in terms of  their vista: a “place of  looking all around” as opposed to a “place of  looking inside.” 
Boas concluded that “geographical names, being an expression of  the mental character of  each 
people and each period, reflect their cultural life and the line of  development belonging to each 
cultural area.” Not only that, but the “form of  each language limits the range of  terms that can be 
coined.”17
In his exposition of  semiotics, philosopher Ernst Cassirer foregrounded the Kantian constraints of  
space, time, and number as the three categories which early language everywhere described. 
Cassirer’s Philosophy of  Symbolic Forms (3 vols., 1923-1929) described the different cosmologies of  the 
ancient world from the Babylonian four-layered Akkad to the Rigveda’s Purusha with its 
correspondence to the human body. The structural variety of  imagined landscapes offered Cassirer 
an illustration of  how different languages directly alter the interpretation of  a shared reality. For 
Cassirer, any sense of  place beyond sun, moon, and stars was a cultural construct, constantly 
evolving from the “perpetual transition” between the culture’s “sense of  place” and the individual’s 
“sensuous distinctions provided by immediate sensation.”18 
This sense of  space was ultimately about the process of  defining self  and other, caught up in the 
simultaneous roles of  architecture and religion in defining a new community. Each culture, Cassirer

15 The smallest trip involved “such a series of  perils and disasters as might suffice for a journey to the Frozen Ocean or 
to the Desert of  Sahara,” and “it happened, almost every day, that coaches stuck fast, until a team of  cattle could be 
procured from some neighbouring farm, to tug them out of  the slough.” Macaulay suggested changes of  magnitude by 
implication rather than by fact. The sticking coaches and deserts of  the imaginary past were described in detail; the 
contemporary improvement was left vague. The historian preached that the seventeenth-century “mode of  travelling” 
on coaches sticking in the mud “seemed to our ancestors wonderfully and indeed alarmingly rapid,” quoting 
seventeenth-century advertisements for the first flying coaches. In contrast, contemporary Englishmen placed on the 
same vehicles would regard them as “insufferably slow.” Everything had been improvement, he argued, castigating the 
past. So too, Macaulay alluded to an even more important shift of  morals, away from “stupidity and obstinancy,” when 
travel was imperiled by danger and highwaymen, towards a new age of  modern travel characterized by “luxury,” 
“liberty,” and “jollity.” Thomas Babington Macaulay, History of  England (London: Longman, Brown, Green, and 
Longmans, 1849), i: 296, 332, 370-374.

argued, at some point in its history therefore developed a sense of  “mythical space” closely akin to 
the “perceptual space” of  an individual, or what any individual in that culture would recognize as 
salient terms in describing himself, his origin, and his purposes. While cultural senses of  place 
evolved, Cassirer conjectured, they did so slowly, for culture, not individual experience, dictates the 
character of  spatial perception.19
Moments of  historical evolution of  a new sense of  space, Cassirer thought, occurred in travel, 
agricultural adaptation, and political change, whenever individuals endowed with “the independent 
energy of  consciousness” “graft[ed]” new form onto “material impressions” already shared by the 
culture. To prove this cultural determination of  perception, Cassirer referenced the wide variation of 
cultural systems for describing landscape. The categories of  space, he argued, varied wildly from 
culture to culture: the number of  cardinal directions, their deific associations, the primary regions of 
the world, their cultural resonance, and the sensory content about landscape used for wayfinding. 
Synthesizing a vast array of  anthropological research, Cassirer referenced the “seven directions” of  
the Zuni, the fourfold mythical geography of  ancient Babylon, the Roman system of  sacred 
threshold, cardo, and decamanus, and then modernity: the age of  the “straight line ‘as such’.” In 
theory, an exhaustive catalogue of  spatial terminology would be sufficient to explain a deeply 
cultural history of  the world.20
But only late in the twentieth century was this method exploited for the purposes Cassirer 
envisioned: the writing of  history for a people who had no written history. In the 1980s, 
anthropologist Keith Basso traveled over the American southwest, talking with Apache consultants 
and hearing the stories associated with each place in their tradition. 
Basso reached the same conclusion as had Boas and Cassirer: “If  place-making is a way of  
constructing the past, a venerable means of  doing human history, it is also a way of  constructing 
social traditions and, in the process, personal and social identities.” In a world with no written 
traditions, place names offered “evidence of  change in the landscape.”21 Earlier historians had failed 
to recognize the Apache historical tradition, expecting an epic of  characters and events, when 
instead history was hidden in place names. The story of  the people was in fact their story about the 
land—their memory of  sites of  veneration where they had once lived and of  associations linked 
with places now vanished. 
In this exploitation of  the language of  space, anthropologists pioneered an important lens for 
understanding the changing culture of  people who did not write their own history in a traditional 
sense. The methods suggest that in studying place names we expand from gazetteer definitions to 
basic spatial concepts such as frontier, boundary, and borderland. It challenges us to track the 
emergence of  new communities and spaces, and read in these imaginary realms the history of  the 
political imagination. 
Applying these methods to vast numbers of  texts opens up the possibility for self-identifying 
emergent political groups whose intellectual motions gave way to physical movement, propelling

them to possess neighborhoods of  the city and there refine their political ideas. Indeed, it suggests 
that historians take seriously the reality of  imaginary and literary places, from the Zion of  Pilgrim’s 
Progress to Middle Earth to hobohemia, insofar as they motivate real travels and constitute political 
boundaries, policed and enacted in architecture and ritual.22 To give one such example, consider 
bohemia. Classically, in Paris, London, New York, and Chicago, “Bohemia” is just such a place—
representing, as Arthur Ransome explained, the movement of  all individuals alienated from the 
evangelical values of  small towns and suburbs, attracted to city cosmopolitanism, who there forged a 
new attitude towards sexuality understood to have catalyzed the spread of  women’s sexuality, 
homosexuality, and psychotherapy.23 As I shall explain below, this mandate to excavate imaginary 
places formed a first criterion for the construction of  my database of  nineteenth-century 
heterotopias. 
A second methodology is the search for mobile communities held together by a linguistic 
understanding of  space. It has its origins with the seventeenth-century German historians of  the 
medieval wandering of  tribes, their ideas consolidated into Hegel’s idea of  “movements” both 
intellectual and physical in history and taken up by writers like Henry Mayhew as an explanation for 
the appearance of  Jews and gypsies in modern London, before being developed between 1890 and 
1910 into a theory of  French, American, and English identity by geographical determinists under 
the influence of  Ratzel—including, most notably, the frontier thesis of  Frederick Jackson Turner.24
The theory was, however, only directly applied to the history of  political radicalism in 1884, when J. 
J. Jusserand penned his influential English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages, which argued for the role 
of  the outlaws in perpetuating international exchanges of  ideas after the fall of  Rome. Jusserand 
explained, “At a period when for the mass of  mankind ideas were transmitted orally and travelled 
with these wanderers along the roads, the nomads served as a true link between the human groups

of  various districts.  It would be therefore of  much interest for the historian to know exactly what 
were these channels of  the popular thought, what life was led by those who fulfilled this function, 
what were their influence and manners.”25 Jusserand’s book was widely absorbed by Anglo-American 
elites, and in 1888, Thomas Wentworth Higginson would use the same conceit to retell the story of  
America as a history of  New England vagabonds, runaway slaves, and maroons.26 
This conceit of  how outcast wanderers had shaped an alternative, radical modernity received new 
life with the blossoming of  the Anglo-American counterculture after the second world war. By the 
1950s, Jusserand’s influence appeared in the works of  Kenneth Allsop, E. J. Hobsbawm, and R. A. 
Leeson, who discerned in the movement of  radical monks, journeymen, tramping artisans, and 
hobos the currents that carried radical ideas of  union organizing and anarchy across nineteenth-
century Europe.27 Higginson’s suggestions were taken up by scholars like Hugo Leaming, Richard 
Price, and later Marcus Rediker and Peter Linebaugh, who argued for the existence of  interracial 
diasporas of  runaway slaves, radical sailors, and native Americans.28 Incidentally, the most radical 
version of  the theory to date was the version offered by Rolling Stone journalist (and Berkeley 
history graduate) Greil Marcus, whose Lipstick Traces (1990) linked dada and punk rock to the roving 
radical monks of  the thirteenth century.29
The radical traveler thesis proved immensely important to understanding radicalism and place-
making in a globalized modernity. Postcolonial scholars like Leila Gandhi and Sumathi Ramaswamy 
have discerned how transnational exchanges of  theosophists and Indian and Tamil nationalists 
depended upon the imagination of  an alternative, shared space where members of  their community 
could address each other on equal terms—frequently envisioned as the astral plane or Lemuria.30 
Working-class historians like Humphry Southall have called attention to the actual spaces of  
tramping artisans and their role in disseminating the politics of  trade unions.31 My first book, Roads

to Power, followed tramping soldiers, Methodists, and artisans over their converging and diverging 
paths through eighteenth-century England. Borrowing from Cassirer, it drew attention to the role of 
imagination in constructing their sense of  space and ultimately of  community. For Methodists, 
heavenly Jerusalem formed the imagined destination of  all ordinary journeys, and Zion was 
structured into their songs, meetings, and sermons as a constant reminder of  what it meant to be a 
people apart from contemporary Britain, united principally by their use of  the roads.
Both methods I have described—the mining of  spatial names as categories for communal values, 
and the scrutiny of  movements of  travelers united by a common identity or imaginary place—lend 
themselves imminently to text-mining and geoparsing on the digital web. Common identifiers like 
“hobohemia” or “trampland” or indeed “bohemia” itself  point to a shared perception of  identity 
mapped onto space, frequently with reference to unique geographical identifiers of  the kind found 
in a gazetteer. 
In theory the nineteenth century, with its major works of  popular fiction, legal treatises, and social 
reform entirely digitized and freely available, should lend itself  to text mining on a grand scale. 
Ideally, a rich database of  nineteenth-century texts would lend itself  to showing the emergence of  
such autonomous, spatially-identified communities, whether populated (as bohemia was) principally 
by elites, or (as trampland was) principally by the working class. The task before me was therefore to 
identify the kinds of  places, real and imaginary, which unified emerging forms of  political agency in 
the nineteenth century.
Trial Databases
The Heterotopia Database represents a preliminary attempt to analyze the emerging spaces of  late 
nineteenth-century London. It was assembled on the basis of  twelve months of  reading primary and 
secondary sources together in an attempt to define, at least preliminarily, some of  the spaces of  the 
nineteenth-century city. Folders were intuitively formed from reading, querying, and repetition; like 
any scholarly endeavor, folders force consistency across eras. The databases allow constrained 
searches within particular tribes that allow the scholar to more easily sort for a common language.
 
The goal of  the database is to ease the description, comparison, and analysis of  heterotopias. The 
heterotopias include those (like bohemia) self-identified in the contemporary literature, those (like 
slumming) identified after the fact by later scholarship, and finally imaginary places (like the deep 
England common to Masefield, Lewis, and Tolkein, or the Lemuria of  the Theosophists) identified 
in the literature.32 These places are categorical and constructed: they may be named with reference to 
the type of  places that appear in gazetteers—for instance, bohemia may be defined in relation to 
Fleet Street. But they are chiefly interesting as the kind of  emergent space of  connections identified 
by scholars of  the history of  mobility as an abstract place which unites travelers in a common 
movement.
The simplest transformation is keyword searching. Constraining the search to a single heterotopia 
helps the process of  analysis, for example looking for discussions of  bohemia in the literature on 
hobos.

Publishers, 1990); for deep England, see Hardy, op. cit.; for Lemuria, see Ramaswamy, op. cit.
A more complicated transformation is mapping the place names. I’m using the Zotero Maps plugin 
as my geoparser, which searches texts for place names, compares them with a gazetteer, and 
produces a map. The maps should allow us to characterize different movements and places; maps 
aid in synthesizing information about these movements (they force the reader to present the span of 
a hundred years next to each other) and maps aid in comparison (the suggestions that arise when 
different subcultures appear to drastically overlap or not). A modest suggestion would be that maps 
might aid the imagination, but the methods of  research are the same.
The maps are merely generative: real analysis comes from reading. The maps provide clues for what 
to keyword search: “Irish” in slumming literature or “Scottish” in fantasy literature. The searchable 
database constrains the search to a finite archive. Patterns discovered can then be properly 
researched: using newspaper archives, Google Books, and traditional biography-based archives. Even 
a few place names open the door to traditional primary research—this is after all how British studies 
proceed in the traditional form, mirroring Lynda Nead’s study of  interactions along the social 
boundary that is Regents Street, or Epstein’s characterization of  eighteenth-century coffeehouse 
life.33 Standard place-name signifiers are useful in locating a particular social scene that remained 
similar over stretches of  time.
First, a few important caveats must be wrapped around any keyword search endeavor. There is 
enormous room for technological improvement in the mapping software. The texts are OCR’d 
rather than keyed; ocr is 90% accurate at best. Second, Zotero Maps is in beta, and I have limited 
information about how well it works. Cursory comparisons of  Zotero Maps with the texts in 
question suggest that for texts this large only perhaps 10% of  place names are making it onto the 
map. Alternative software demonstrates what improvement might look like: Gutenkarte is a good 
example, and Geomaker is actually quite good; neither can handle new texts of  the size in question 
(500 page studies, novels, in sets of  10-30). The results of  this preliminary trial are therefore 
impressionistic at best—my conclusions heavily couched by recourse to the traditional method of  
reading secondary sources and coming to my own conclusions. Nonetheless—couched in secondary 
readings as they are—the preliminary results are suggestive, and some tentative avenues for future 
research may be forwarded.
Even Preliminary Databases Suggest New Connections in the Literature
The maps allow us to see new connections. Sometimes several movements intersect in space and 
time, bending the same physical to different movements. The standard secondary literature on the 
East End emphasizes it not as heterotopia but as the physical site of  the fashioning of  sociological 
expertise, where Charles Booth and Helen Bosanquet developed many of  the metrics for measuring 
poverty and deprivation that would later be employed by the welfare state.34 These studies tend to 
read intensively in a small body of  sociologists’ literature without contextualizing the spatial 
dynamics of  the social explorers’ travels.

In contrast to the standard literature, the maps emphasize first of  all the spatial distance between 
East End and West. We know from the literature on public health and mapping how isolated the 
social and economic practices of  the two sides of  London became after the building of  the 
“sanitary cordon” of  Regent Street in 1815. The rise of  social explorers, driven forward from the 
1820s by sexual interest, was encouraged in the 1850s by a journalistic literature exoticizing the 
“tribes” of  the East End, and these impulses gradually gave rise to the Settlement House movement 
and to sociological explorers.35 Merely mapping the texts is sufficient to remind us that sociology 
still partook of  a transgression into a space that was still a heterotopia. If  we map the other texts 
that highlight the division between East and West, the significance of  border-crossing becomes all 
the more clear.
Bohemian London, for instance, was zone of  transgression enough for most London elites. 
Concentrated around the theater district of  the Haymarket and the writers’ haven of  Fleet Street and 
the Temple, bohemia stood for the possibilities of  aesthetic radicalism. But bohemia was barely 
East, hardly East at all. The preliminary maps, mapping bohemia, demonstrate a concentration of  
references to the area around the Temple and the City.
The maps of  spiritual movements demonstrate more references to sites further east. It was so much 
further to go into the East End proper. The more radical movement east united sexual tourists and 
Settlement movement workers with free-thinking feminists and theosophists like Annie Besant, 
whose career as a union organizer, advocate of  birth control, and theosophist guru spanned all the 
movements of  the East End. Such texts tend to foreground the East End as a site for studying 
divergent world views and the nature of  phenomenological difference itself. Theosophist texts like 
Leadbeater’s Devachanic Plane, which foregrounds the possibility of  psychic intuition of  distant places 
and events, raise the question about whether girls in the East End are as competent psychics as 
those in the West.36
By reading intensively within each literature about its use of  the East End, we receive a very 
different picture of  the uses of  the East End than that traditionally presented in the historiography 
that stresses social exploration, sexual commodification, and official reification of  minorities and 
women in East London. Rather, other texts stress the East End as the site of  the sensitization of  
radicals to a broader and international politics. 
A map of  “hobohemia,” gleaned by references to places made in texts by and about tramps, 
suggests another scene of  association between different classes where slumming led elites further 
east. These interactions may have differed in nature and kind from those of  charity movements and 
settlement houses, as the narratives in the texts suggest. First transgressing eastward to bohemia 
could thus lead to a more serious encounter east later. George Borrow, author of  Lavengro, was 
notorious for taking pasty bohemian writers with him to trampland to get into first political 
arguments and then fist fights with hobos. These connections between east and west, between 
bohemia and trampland, were being actively cultivated by the end of  the century in a literature on 
vagabondage. W. H. Davies, a poetry-writing tramp whose leg had been crushed hopping trains in

Canada, tried in vain to publish his poetry until discovered by the bohemian and social explorer 
George Sims. Other tramps too became celebrities only after contact with bohemia. Flynt was a 
runaway from juvenile reform school, who had left his immigrant family behind in order to seek the 
wandering tramp culture of  Germany and England, when he befriended the poet and essayist 
Arthur Symons in London. Symons urged upon Flynt the example of  George Borrow and Richard 
Burton, attempting to persuade him to record his travels, as he eventually did.37 The journey from 
hobohemia to bohemia was made in reverse as well. A modern culture of  slummers in disguise 
began with journalist Greenwood’s overnight stay in East London, but was followed by other 
journalists and social reformers. Jack London’s year disguised as working man in East London 
converted him from Nietzchean individualism to socialism. 
In exploring the interpenetrating journeys that defined heterotopias, a new definition of  political 
agency opens up. Rather than telling a story about commodification and exoticization from above, 
these stories open up the possibility of  political alliances of  elites and subalterns. The maps may 
help us to better identify the individuals who acted as social bridges in a real sense. Tramps and 
reformers both took to vagabonding as a means of  exploring the social reality. Part-time criminals, 
beggars, and sailors like Flynt, Davies, and Masefield were converted to literary celebrity as they 
attempted to convert their early experiences for a popular audience, and bohemians like Sims, 
Symons, and London became part-time tramps in the search. The exchanges between both worlds—
motivated by working-class individuals’ desire to reap the rewards of  distribution and income on the 
one hand, and literary individuals’ desire for exposure to other worlds—defined both trampland and 
bohemia as imagined community. 
Small journeys eastward could lead, in this telling, to even greater journeys east. Max Pemberton’s 
Aladdin, for instance, urges his boy readers to see East London as the nexus of  international 
connections between anarchist, Jewish freedom fighters who have fled the purges in Poland. The 
hero, Albion, a casual laborer working at the docks, comes to understand his own political 
commitments only as a result of  following these international journeys, and learning to see the 
Jewish East End not merely as a site of  compassion but of  political acumen.  The book is a veritable 
travel manual of  entering and escaping London’s heterotopias, for Albion is an urban explorer of  
worlds above his own as well as below. Pemberton describes him this way: “He loved to roam afar in 
quest, not of  material booty, but of  mental sensation. An imagination that was simply wonderful 
helped him upon his way.”38 Albion cavorts with Polish anarchist emigres, flunkee heroin-addicted 
ex-clergy, prostitutes, and a pansy boy named “Betty” in the courts and alleys of  Whitechapel. With 
their aid, he descends into the labyrinthine subterranean passages underneath Pall Mall and the 
Haymarket, discovering there “a city below a city.”39 Many of  these heterotopias have further 
connections. The Jewish East End turns out to be connected to anarchist plots to free Poland from 
Russian control, and Hampstead bankers’ finance of  the Czar links the pogroms of  Russia with 
London high society. When Albion arrives in Warsaw, searching for the anarchist he loves, his 
contacts lay out for him the heterotopias of  that place too: “Every public square stands for an 
insurrection. The castle is fortified not against the stranger but the citizen—those guns you tell me

about were put there by Nicolas to remind us that he would stand no nonsense.”40 The czarists draw 
even more explicit connections between London’s heterotopias and the map of  the world: “You 
preach civilization instead—and we point to your Whitechapel, your Belleville, your Bowery. Just 
think of  it, your upper classes, as you yourselves admit, are utterly decadent, alike in brains and in 
morals; your middle classes are smug hypocrites—your lower classes starve in filthy dens. This is 
what you desire to bring about in Russia under the name of  freedom and liberty.”41 At the end of  
his adventures, wedded to the anarchist he loves, Albion concludes of  his adventures high and low:

citadel of  riches and know that so many of  my poor people were starving not ten miles from my 
door. I would feel as though I had gone into the enemy’s camp and sold myself  for the gratification 
of  a few silly desires and a whole pantomime laugh at.”42 The possibility of  movement east, across 
London and across the continent, stood for the possibility of  attending to the culpabilities of  
privilege and class. Pemberton urged upon his teenage readers just this form of  movement and 
responsibility, framing in the persona of  Albion a new model for British identity as socially-
conscious explorer.
These movements from eastward exposure to international movements east had correlates in real 
life as well. After her success leading the 1886 matchgirl workers’ strike, Annie Besant poured her 
efforts into Theosophy, which she saw as offering the swifter means of  race and class reconciliation 
through immediate, spiritual transcendence of  world view. Her conversion took her to Calcutta, 
where she helped to launch the first interracial university. Besant’s example drew other theosophists 
after her, and the movement from west London to East End to India drew an increasing movement 
of  countercultural explorers in a train across the globe.43
Such connections tell us something about the local heterotopias that were points of  connection for 
Londoners moving towards the international politics of  human rights. They also suggest how 
international and multifaceted the programs of  outreach were, and how peculiar the points of  
contact. The creation of  new worlds and their increasing interpenetration evidences the continuous 
and evolving reality of  political agency from below.
Furthermore, international connections between heterotopias raise further historiographical 
questions about the nature of  heterotopias and their relationship with each other. Indeed, these 
international journeys help us to understand earlier heterotopias in a new light. The best-read text of 
the nineteenth century after the Bible was an allegory of  a traveler on the path, that is, John 
Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, first published in 1678. The classical allegory of  the wanderer resonated 
with seventeenth-century itinerant preaching communities of  which he was a member; it later 
became a key text and a rich metaphor for wandering Moravians and Methodists. By the nineteenth 
century, it became the single most published text in Britain after the Bible. The dissemination of  
Bunyan to the British colonies began around 1848 as missionary activity intensified and Bunyan 
became the seminal text of  the movement. Isabel Hofmeyr describes the variety of  ways that 
Bunyan was promoted, from jigsaw puzzles to sermons, within the Nonconformist context. Pilgrim’s

Progress was disseminated by mission societies and translated into 130 languages. She theorizes that 
one reason for Bunyan’s popularity was a common worldwide culture of  the hero’s journey. 
Contemporaries declaimed upon the fact that everyone around the world had read the same story. In 
fact, the context of  his conquest in Britain aligns more with the popularization of  “poor man’s 
classics” in workingmens’ and Nonconformist celebrations of  English literature (as opposed to 
classical or ancient languages) between 1848 and 1932.44 The progress of  John Bunyan shows how 
the idiom of  travel was capitalized upon for the purposes of  creating new, international connections, 
literally driving the movement of  missionaries abroad to recast the journeys of  strangers in light of  
their allegory. As late nineteenth-century travelers moved eastward to bohemia, East London, 
eastern Europe, and ultimately India, the shape of  their travels was increasingly paralleled by the 
international distribution of  copies of  Bunyan. As the travelers spread, their imaginary kingdom of  
travel spread with them, translating the idea of  the traveler to new realms. One could further 
reference the experience of  Bunyan in America and work on the dissemination of  Robinson Crusoe. 
My point is that if  we take exchanges between heterotopias seriously as a point of  the production of 
radical politics, each of  these sites of  distribution becomes another possible site of  inquiry. We can 
explore international connections even further by looking at the maps of  other heterotopias with 
global connections. 
The places mined for imaginary worlds constitute one such broadening of  the imagination into 
distant worlds. In 1851, George Borrow, a law-school dropout who spent most of  his time talking to 
tramps and travelers on Mousehold Heath, published his Lavengro, a story of  a wanderer who falls in 
among the gypsies and learns to appreciate from them the possibility of  a radical reconciliation with 
nature, free from the patterns of  consumption and social pressure that typified city life. According 
to George Behlmer, “Gypsies were monuments to the Victorian ideal of  mens sana in corpore sano 
(a sound mind in a sound body).”45 Lavengro became one of  the most popular texts of  the century, 
along with Borrow’s other writings about gypsies, and ultimately launched a culture of  Romany 
language enthusiasts, cataloguers of  gypsydom, other would-be gypsy travelers, and biographers of  
Borrow himself. Most of  these enthusiasts were armchair or local travelers, but their catalogues of  
gypsy history took them on imaginary journeys around the whole of  Europe and as far as India as 
they recorded oral histories and employed historical linguistics to the purposes of  tracing possible 
gypsy heritage. So great was the lure of  this imaginary alterity, writes Behlmer, that it launched a 
literal movement of  would-be vagabonds. “So salubrious did the wandering life appear that during 
the last two decades of  the century, fresh-air-starved gentlemen began to hire or buy caravans in 
which they spent holidays on the road, ‘Romany-style’,” thus anticipating the back-to-the-land 
movement that gained traction in the early decades of  the twentieth century.46 The map of  places 
referenced in gypsy writings suggests the breadth of  imaginary journeys; gypsies, like Jews,

represented a wandering nation who embodied by another route the cosmopolitan exchanges of  
civilization and empire. It was an alternative imagination of  the geography of  empire.47
The maps help us contextualize gypsydom against even still other alternative empires being 
propagated at the same time. We would expect a map of  deep England, drawn from the writings of  
George Macdonald, Andrew Lang, John Masefield, J. R. R. Tolkein, and C. S. Lewis, to constrain the 
alternative England to a smaller geography in which empire’s alternative is worked out with 
reference. But indeed, the intriguing thing is actually not so much familiar England as the old 
colonial periphery of  the north, where Macdonald and Lang had turned as a source for a new 
peasant culture, entrenched in magic, connected to nature, and uncorrupted by modern civilization.48 
Far different are the sites of  deep England located in the narratives of  Thoreau’s British followers 
who studied sea, light, and forest in an attempt to recapture a spirit of  place.49 Different again are 
the enthusiasts for local village politics like Miss Mitford, who began to appear with an upsurge of  
enthusiasm for local government towards the end of  the century.50 If  we mine the texts for images 
instead of  place names, the patterns are still deeper. Romantic walkers moved in a different visual 
world entirely than antiquarians or village appreciators; land reformers were rarely in the places 
where there were social explorers.

We see something then like the fissioning of  heterotiopia into a series of  isolated worlds—each 
reading intensively a set of  texts, each moving in a geographically isolated sphere. Few of  these 
worlds—deep England, romantic walking, and village appreciation—corresponded in any deep 
sense with the other heterotopias. These are the topoi of  isolation, and their proliferation towards 
the end of  the nineteenth century 
The analysis of  disconnection allows a scholar to more systematically engage some of  the spatial 
questions about the nature of  class, race, and culture in nineteenth-century Britain. From very early 
in the century, a common theme in this literature is mutual invisibility. Cobbett complained about 
the invisibility of  the poor from the new highway system in the 1820s; Engels echoed him in 
describing Manchester in the 1830s. By the 1840s, it was commonplace for literature to describe the 
“two nations” of  rich and poor, city and country, and to worry about their fate. Contemporary 
historians have likewise called attention to spatial distance between the dwellings of  the poor and the 
rich as one of  the features shaping class and race experience in the nineteenth century.
This fissioning landscape represents one foundational force in history—the rise of  invisible 
boundaries that divided the British nation, increasingly separating the landscape not only by gender, 
race, and class, but also by aesthetic inclination and political subparty, into a hundred heterotopias 
that rarely coincided with each other in space and time.
Against this force moved, dialectically, the efforts of  those social bridge-makers like Davies, Flynt, 
and Besant, whose journeys unified heterotopias rather than remaining confined in them. Borrow’s 
journeys begot Symon’s journeys, and Besant’s were followed by those of  Gandhi’s white disciples 
and ultimately the whole of  the twentieth century counterculture. 
 
These then are a pattern for seeing agency from below: those from below who retreated into 
separate worlds, building up the boundaries around them, further defining race, class, gender, and 
subculture into a thousand fissioned worlds; and those who became social bridges, moving across 
entrenched boundaries, exploring and taking others with them. Political agency, in such an account, 
was not simply crushed by the abstracting and assorting mechanisms of  the state, and limited to a 
few violent encounters. Rather, the agency to transform the social, political, and economic landscape 
of  division lay with those few activists like Annie Besant who actively bridged and broke down the 
barriers of  class and race, forging new connections out of  their own journeys.
The new methodology here relies upon new sources. In the study of  this form of  agency, new 
sources indeed become important: imaginary places are evidence of  the political imagination, and 
everyday journeys are evidence of  political movement. Those sources can only be rigorously studied 
in more than the anecdotal and impressionistic sense here with the help of  new, digital methods that 
sort masses of  texts.
