1. Introduction
Digital archives are threatened by obsolescence caused by deterioration of  storage media, 
abandonment of  outmoded standards for operating systems and software, and failure to maintain 
the viability of  legacy materials for use on new physical/mechanical systems. Projects can be further 
hindered by use of  eccentric standards and one-off  solutions to local problems. Standard responses 
to these threats include: to use ASCII or Unicode files with standard TEI tagging, to provide 
adequate documentation, to migrate the material periodically to new storage media, and to hope that 
someone will continue to be interested enough and knowledgeable enough to maintain the scholarly 
integrity of  content.
New approaches to durability and maintenance, pioneered in scientific fields, follow principles of  
modular component structure, connectivity, extensibility, and methods for identifying and crediting 
researchers with their individual contributions to composite research projects. These new trends 
allow decentralized changes to software and its sources. In free/open source (FOSS) projects, the 
past was dominated largely by projects where the code was kept under tight wraps, using version 
control systems such as CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and Subversion. Only a handful of  
FOSS projects have been successful using this model, notably the Firefox project, but many FOSS 
projects are already migrating to more distributed approaches (e. g. the Python language and Linux 
kernel development) Much like archives, software development projects in the FOSS community 
tend to self-organize and establish their own governance. While they tend to make their code 
available (as required by the FOSS licensing schemes) they also tend to fall into disuse or an 
unmaintained state, making it hard for new developers to come along and take the project to the 
next level. Worse, some successful projects should be branched to allow for new approaches to be 
demonstrated.
Distributed version control systems (one of  the earliest examples being GNU Arch, with a more 
complete listing at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Version_Control_System) are gaining 
traction and interest within the past two years, wherein a project’s entire history and state can be 
copied freely, allowing derived works to take place. When a copy is made, however, the entire history 
is kept intact, allowing new contributors to either make their own changes or to push their changes 
back to the original maintainer. The push/pull model is so sophisticated that anyone who makes 
changes can get recognition for their work, because their specific changes to the code are encoded in 
the derived history. In the end, because we are working with plain text (structured or unstructured), 
the same tools can be used for maintaining texts (and their versions), much like source code (subject 
to having a proper merge model, which we address in our research). E-Carrel incorporates these 
principles and adds the functions of  stand-off  markup and annotation and a dynamic authentication 
mechanism, neither of  which is as yet a standard function in humanities research projects. 
Experimentation by some projects has, however, shown the considerable promise of  such

functionality. As examples, we will discuss the Just in Time Markup (JITM) system
1
 and the work on 
multi-versioned documents (MVD).
2
 These important building blocks and new ideas come together 
in E-Carrel as a coherent vision for preservation and access, realized in the form of  tools and 
programming frameworks. As indicated below, E-Carrel is designed to be interoperable with other 
current Humanities texts projects, but we focus on the fundamentals of  textual scholarship, where 
most other projects focus on higher order functions that assume textual stability.
The E-Carrel solution for text preparation and dissemination that enables collaboration and 
participation by any interested scholar while maintaining file security and avoiding the conflicts and 
corruptions endemic to Wiki solutions. Another problem of  Wiki systems is that text often cannot 
be exported– all or in part–from the system. Our system allows for easy export and copying, which 
is essential to meaningfully preservation solutions. The system’s textual basis we call the CorTex (not 
to be confused with the TEX and LATEX software, used to prepare this document), which bears 
the bibliographical and textual data of  all versions of  a work. In typical use, The CorTex is copied 
and distributed on the Internet, guarded by a checksum against corruption to ensure longevity and 
integrity. Our collaborative construction and enhancement tool, CaTT, enables both the 
construction of  a project’s CorTex foundation and its enhancement with stand-off  markup and 
annotation in any standard coding (for example TEI conformant XML). E-Carrel’s stand-off  
markup and annotation leverages existing RDF capabilities modeled in part on the JITM experience 
and on the MVD (Multi-Variant Documents) work by Schmidt and Fiormonte. While XML-aware, 
E-Carrel is markup agnostic. Our user interface (The Carrel) not only incorporates CaTT but 
provides a Carrel Desktop for aggregating, reading, analysing, commenting and enhancing projects. 
The Carrel Desktop allows the importation of  materials from other systems and prepares 
perspectives of  the Carrel materials for export in various forms compatible with other systems (such 
as PDF and in-line coded XML). The system serves not only to create and use literary projects but 
ensures long-term maintenance and growth through collective ownership and distributed storage 
and the principle of  LOCKSS (Lots of  copies keep stuff  safe). E-Carrel projects will have 
usefulness and purposes beyond the originators’ interest span and the functions they imagined for 
the project. By increasing access to humanities texts as useful, adaptable, reliable source materials, E-
Carrel projects will attract continuing contributions by both literary and digital scholars to maintain 
the viability of  the tools and materials.
2. Motivation and Aims
The E-Carrel project addresses the fact that truly collaborative electronic knowledge sites in 
humanities fields do not yet exist. Two models now dominate: closed proprietary projects and open 
wikis. The former emphasizes the integrity of  texts (and necessarily limits collaboration) and the 
latter emphasizes sharing (at the expense of  guaranteeing the integrity of  texts). Both systems now 
are dominated by in-line coding methods. Electronic knowledge site creation is hindered by standard 
methodologies which have structures vulnerable to damage during collaborative engagement. Yet, 
true knowledge sites, too big a task for one person, require collaborative efforts. Furthermore, 
standard methods fail to ensure endurance beyond the interest or life of  project originators.

Although E-Carrel focuses on literary objects and texts for testing purposes, its application to music, 
philosophy, and historical texts is without question and its further application to archaeology, 
painting, and architecture is palpable. Electronic knowledge sites should consist of  the primary 
evidence (objects and images and transcriptions of  them) in all their significant forms, contextual 
and ancillary documents linked to primary items, critical and analytical engagements that produce 
new knowledge, and enhancement open to all, but protected from unwanted changes or intrusive 
alterations.
To succeed in a collaborative environment of  inquiry, E-Carrel offers sound foundation in 
authenticated representations of  primary source texts (images and transcriptions), a secure 
mechanism for allowing multiple users to add new work without inadvertently corrupting the work 
of  others, and a user friendly system for browsing ever growing, widely distributed, dynamically 
accessible literary knowledge sites.
Put another way, E-Carrel aims:
•
To allow multiple editors and commentators to add scholarly value to basic text files in an 
Edition/Archive/Knowledge Site.
•
To do that without threatening the scholarly integrity of  core text files. • To do that without 
proliferating text files each enhanced differently and accessible only as isolated forms of  the 
project.
•
To enable scholarly value to be added to core text files in such a way that all enhancements will 
be accessible to the user of  any single copy of  the text files.
•
To track and give credit to every student/scholar for the enhancements added or attached to 
the text files.
•
To provide a user-friendly tagging tool so that scholarly enhancements (tagging) can be added 
with minimal technical expertise.
•
To provide a browsing environment enabling students of  the text to navigate the textual 
project and to know precisely what form of  the work is being looked at and what alternatives 
and analyses are available.
•
To take advantage of  distributed text and enhancement files where the number of  copies of  
the original text files and the number of  places where enhancement files are housed is 
irrelevant to a user who will have access to all of  it.
•
To ensure preservation of  digital texts and their scholarly enhancements by 1) proliferating 
copies, 2) by keeping projects dynamic and growing beyond the engagement of  their creators, 
and 3) by giving scholars a vested interest in the continuance of  the texts and scholarly 
enhancements.
2.1. Present State of  Knowledge
Although digital text archives are the foundation for creative electronic engagements with primary 
works, digital archives are currently threatened by obsolescence caused by deterioration of  storage 
media, abandonment of  outmoded standards for operating systems and software, failure to maintain 
the viability of  legacy materials for use on new physical/mechanical systems, and use of  eccentric 
standards and one-off  solutions to local problems.
Standard responses to these threats include use of  ASCII or Unicode files with standard TEI 
tagging, providing adequate documentation, migrating the material periodically to new storage 
media, aiming to form alliances with university libraries or academic departments to ensure a stable

home for materials, and hoping that someone will continue to be interested enough and 
knowledgeable enough to maintain the scholarly integrity of  content over time.
Electronic projects that restrict construction and enhancement to a select few persons as a way to 
protect the intellectual integrity of  their resources inadvertently introduce a significant threat to the 
durability of  text files, whose hard-won accuracy is the result of  expert attention. Anxiety to protect 
projects dependent on in-line tagging leads to proprietary attitudes and methods detrimental to 
collaboration because everyone knows that the text files are vulnerable to inadvertent change every 
time they are reopened for further tagging. Protective restriction also restricts collaborative work. 
Sharing copies of  files for re-purposing or enhancement with non-team members proliferates 
parallel variant projects with finished in-line coded projects–project that must be accessed separately, 
with no general access point, no way for markup of  one text to apply to other copies of  the same 
work, no preservation scheme, no integrated distribution plan, no collaborative expansion potential, 
no constituency with a vested interest, no capabilities beyond what it was designed to yield, no 
invitations to contributing members, no functions beyond those imagined by its creators, no long-
term maintenance.
These problems can be mitigated or eliminated by new approaches to collaboration, durability, and 
maintenance, pioneered in scientific fields following principles of  modular component structure, 
connectivity, extensibility, distribution and aggregation systems, stand-off  enhancement mechanisms, 
and methods for identifying and crediting researchers with their individual contributions to 
composite research projects.
These new trends allow decentralized changes to software and its sources. But even free/open 
source (FOSS) projects are not without problems. The past was dominated largely by projects where 
the code was kept under tight wraps, using version control systems such as CVS (Concurrent 
Versions System) and Subversion. Only a handful of  FOSS projects succeed with this model, 
notably the Firefox project, but many FOSS projects are already migrating to more distributed 
approaches (the Python language, the Linux kernel, etc.) Much like archives, software development 
projects in the FOSS community self-organize and establish their own governance. While they tend 
to make their code available (as required by the FOSS licensing schemes) they tend to fall into disuse 
or an unmaintained state, making it hard for new developers to come along and take the project to 
the next level. Worse, some successful projects should be branched to allow for new approaches to 
be demonstrated.
Nevertheless, distributed version control systems (DVCS) record a project’s entire history and state, 
which can be copied freely, allowing derived works to take place. When a copy is made, however, the 
entire history is kept intact, allowing new contributors to either make their own changes or to push 
their changes back to the original maintainer. The push/pull model is so sophisticated that anyone 
who makes changes can get recognition for their work, because their specific changes to the code 
are encoded in the derived history. Some interesting DVCSs that could be incorporated (and 
evolved) as part of  this work include Mercurial, Git, and darcs, among others. In the end, because 
we are working with plain text (structured or unstructured), the same tools can be used for 
maintaining texts (and their versions), much like source code.
The E-Carrel environment incorporates these principles and adds the functions of  stand-off  files 
for markup and annotation and a dynamic authentication mechanism, neither of  which is as yet a 
standard function in humanities, social science and arts research projects. Experimentation has

shown the considerable promise of  such functionality, found in the Just-in-Time Markup (JITM) 
system

 and Multi-Versioned Documents (MVD).

These building blocks and ideas come together in E-Carrel as a coherent vision for archiving 
creative works for collaboration, preservation, and dynamic interactive access, realized in the form of 
tools and programming frameworks. E-Carrel focuses on the fundamentals of  textual scholarship, 
where most other projects focus on analytical and commentary functions that assume textual 
stability, inadvertently reinforcing proprietary tendencies. E-Carrel is designed to be interoperable 
with other current humanities texts projects.
3. Approach and Architecture
Although in the early stages of  development, E-Carrel is built on a solid architectural and 
component-oriented foundation.. Our approach establishes an image file and a base text for each 
significant version of  a work. Text data for all texts are compressed in an inviolable CorTex file 
which anchors all stand-off  enhancement contributions. Each participant’s contribution is credited, 
and protected from work by other contributors. End-users choose a historical text or critical edition 
plus desired types of  enhancements from a menu dynamically aggregated from distributed sources. 
The E-Carrel processes and presents perspectives of  texts and enhancements for viewing, printing, 
or export in commonly used formats. E-Carrel system projects do not require an editorial board but 
individual projects using the system can vet and certify parts of  a project. And this system allows the 
storage, retrieval, and coordination of  conflicting and even hostilely different editorial or critical 
approaches to the same literary work.
E-Carrel develops collaborative functions for creating, enhancing and repurposing foundational 
textual archives and scholarship in a modular, distributed but coherent form. By giving scholars and 
students a vested interest in a growing integrated collaborative project, E-Carrel ensures 
preservation and access to textual research projects and their superstructure of  critical analysis at the 
same time that it promotes collaboration beyond the project initiators’ participation and goals. 
Project viability follows community ownership and becomes a widely distributed responsibility.
The system ensures long-term maintenance and growth through collective ownership, distributed 
storage, and the principle of  LOCKSS (Lots of  copies keep stuff  safe). Our strong definition of  
LOCKSS, in which accurate copies, verified by way of  the persistent CorText data and checksum 
system, is significantly different from the “soft” version of  LOCKSS that just sends “copies” into 
the world in whatever state and trusts to the hive mind for endurance and integrity.
E-Carrel leverages RDF capabilities and is XML-aware but markup-agnostic. It allows the 
importation of  materials from other systems and prepares perspectives of  the E-Carrel materials for 
export in various forms compatible with other systems (such as PDF and in-line coded XML).
E-Carrel involves several interrelated foundational concepts:
•
Images and Transcriptions: Humanistic study of  texts builds creative knowledge on foundation 
textual documents: the answer to the verification and literary research question, “where did

that text come from?” is always a document. Except in born-digital projects, it is never the 
electronic transcription of  a document. Hence the cornerstones of  E-Carrel are high-
definition digital images of  documents backed by accurate transcriptions
•
Relationships: Humanistic understanding of  textual foundations involves knowing the 
relationships among variant documents representing the same work. Text-comparison 
(collation) tools are needed for use with images and with transcriptions.
•
Collaboration: Documentary texts are the foundation for analysis and annotations tagged 
onto the texts. Stand-off  tagging allows collaborative work by multiple participants while 
ensuring the integrity of  “shared” files.
•
Tagging Tool: Humanists (rather than programmers and Digital Humanities persons) require 
a user-friendly tagging-tool to tag text files–hence, CaTT (Collaborative Tagging Tool).
3.1. Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)
FRBR was devised by the library community as the emerging common standard for cataloguing 
library materials. Its application to textual studies and digital humanities rests on its taxonomy: a 
descending hierarchy, from the abstract to the material, that identifies bibliographic items (material 
books and documents) and places them in relation to other versions in categories that help us 
understand their history and significance as items and incorporates additional information about the 
item (e.g., agency, events, provenance, etc.).
•
Work: refers to the title or identifying description and refers to all forms belonging to that 
title or description. Thus Hamlet exists in many documentary forms from the early 17th 
century to the present and includes stage performances.
•
Expression: refers to versions of  a work and distinguishes between drafts, and revised 
versions . Thus, the early version of  Hamlet represented first in a 1603 quarto, is an 
‘expression’ that persists in all copies and reprints that follow that version. The Folio 
represents a different expression.
•
Manifestation: distinguishes between the various forms of  a text representing a specific 
expression of  the work. All copies of  the first quarto of  Hamlet belong to a single 
manifestation of  the work, but facsimiles and all other reprints would belong to separate 
‘manifestations’ of  that ‘expression’ of  the ‘work’.
•
Item: refers to the individual material document. Any and every book or manuscript or 
pamphlet obtained by a library is catalogued as an ‘item’ and its cataloguing involves 
determining what Work, Expression, and Manifestation it belongs to, and what 
distinguishing features identify this copy from all other copies.
A Few Words about Electronic Items
An electronic text file represents a Work only as an Item–an actual book or manuscript—and, thus, 
represents the work only partially. No item can represent all the different manifestations of  all the 
different expressions of  a work. When there are multiple variant texts, all representing one work, but 
each representing a different expression and manifestation of  the work, textual analysis and 
scholarly editing provide the ways to understand the relations among the texts and the significance 
of  each text.
This fact is not obvious to most users of  electronic editions nor to most providers of  electronic 
texts, many of  whom believe that any text of  Jane Eyre or Hamlet is sufficient to represent the 
work.

In E-Carrel projects the basic “thing” upon which projects are built is the bibliographic ITEM. In 
order for an electronic project to represent a ‘work’ comprehensively, it needs to represent an ‘item’ 
from each ‘manifestation’ of  each ‘expression’ of  the ‘work’ that was deemed authoritative or 
important. The CorTex for an E-Carrel project compresses into a singe file the data for all of  the 
items deemed relevant to a full representation all authoritative expressions of  the work.
3.2. E-Carrel tools
E-Carrel comprises the following tools.
•
CorTex is a compression process merging variant text files of  a single work (manuscripts, 
proofs, first editions, revisions) into a single text data file to serve as the anchor for stand-
off  markup and annotation. It consists of  both merging and extraction routines, 
checksums, and naming protocols for distributed storage.
•
CaTT is a Collaborative Tagging Tool offering users a dynamic menu of  tagging options 
and applying and storing XML or other codes in either in-line or stand-off  mode, applying 
appropriate naming protocols. It tracks tagging sessions and tagging sources so that each 
collaborator is credited with his/her own work and stores them so that when a project user 
(as opposed to developer) accesses the project, enhancements are grouped, at the user’s 
discretion, according to type or according to contributor.
•
COOL is a collation and file management system that displays extracted text data by joining 
text images to text transcriptions and offering several options for display of  variants 
(standard windowbox variants lists, parallel texts with highlights, links to explanations of  
complex revisions, etc.) COOL uses new tools (Xray, Transparent, and e-Hinman) to 
manage images and transcriptions of  variant forms of  the same text.
•
E-Carrel is the general tool for developers and users, offering CaTT to developers and 
serving as aggregate and browser for users. It aggregates the distributed files of  a given 
project, activates COOL display mechanisms, and generates perspectives from dynamically 
produced menus of  enhancement files available on the Internet.
3.3. Development principles
We are guided by the following overarching design and development principles:
•
E-Carrel, in all its parts, projects and tools is an on-line, Internet function.
•
E-Carrel’s modular, component parts are built separately, revised separately, removed and 
added separately, and can be augmented with additional modular tools and content objects.
•
E-Carrel will work with non-Carrel projects opened or dragged onto the desktop, though its 
design makes it especially apt for projects using stand-off  markup and developed with CaTT.
•
E-Carrel produces export-perspectives of  texts plus enhancements for print or distribution in 
various forms for use with other text software, for example in PDF and XML forms.
•
Transcriptions have a default presentation position hidden behind the image they transcribe.
•
Desktop openings for tools and perspectives can be resized, repositioned, and saved.
•
Tools for multiple views of  a single text file or for simultaneous views of  variant files will be 
linked so that scrolling in one view is kept pace with in other views.
•
Display tools (like Transparent) can trigger related tools (like COOL and its sub-tools Xray, e-
Hinman, etc.)
•
Overall interface design for E-Carrel will inherit that of  WoolfOnline and have all of  that 
project’s basic capabilities: the ability to move from anywhere in the project to any other place

with no more than a click or two; the ability to accommodate multiple ways of  looking at the 
same thing; the ability to zoom images; the ability to accommodate many kinds of  data and 
analysis such as pictures, annotations, commentary, articles, audio and video, as well as the 
genetic documentary materials described above; the ability to provide synchronic and 
diachronic mapping tools; and enable the personalizing, appropriating aspects already available 
in WoolfOnline.
E-Carrel improves upon the WoolfOnline design according to the principles above. CorTex 
construction and the associated stand-off  tagging files must be available in fine-grained open-able, 
size-able, drag-able perspectives in windows inside E-Carrel’s desktop and able to interact with 
Transparent and Cool. That is, although E-Carrel has a modular, component structure in both tools 
and content objects, it provides project coherence through E-Carrel’s ability to “be aware” of  each 
part’s relationships with other text documents and tagged enhancements that can be opened in the 
desktop area. This has serious implications for the development of  the collation and variants display 
capabilities.
3.4. Standards
Preparing Files for Tagging Texts of  Works
FRBR concepts about variant forms of  a work are important to E-Carrel because some annotations 
are specific to the item, while some apply to all copies of  a manifestation, or to all manifestations of 
an expression, or to all expressions of  a work. Since annotation (tagging) is always done in relation 
to an item, a system is needed to distinguish analyses and commentaries that apply to all expressions 
of  the work from those which apply only to manifestations of  a particular expression and from 
those which apply only to certain copies (items) of  a manifestation. Otherwise, in order to be 
comprehensive every variant bibliographic item in a project would require a separate electronic file, 
each with in-line tagging, much of  which would be the same for all copies of  the work, some to all 
copies of  one expression, some to all copies of  a manifestation, and some to a unique copy. Without 
a system to coordinate and distinguish tagging, a discouraging (infeasible) redundancy of  labor 
ensues.
The E-Carrel solution involves preparing minimally tagged base transcriptions for all relevant 
(authoritative or significant) items of  a work (which are the core texts for a work), proofing them to 
the highest standards, and then merging them into a single compressed file (the CorTex) that enables
•
item-level representation of  text-images with associated relevant transcription–extracted from 
the CorTex by E-Carrel,
•
collation and display of  textual variation–extracted by COOL,
•
stand-off  markup that automatically applies any tag to all the items for which it is appropriate 
but targets tags that apply to unique items or subsets of  works.
This process is new and (so far) unique to E-Carrel. The CorTex is locked with a hash key that 
allows it to be used for multiple purposes but not changed by those uses. Any change in the text 
would disable the hash key, indicating corruption of  the file.
Stand-off  markup and annotation: Markup with CaTT can be in-line or stand-off. In-line markup 
embeds comments, instructions, and qualifications in a code such as XML into a text file, giving the 
computer instructions on how to display the text and where to put additional commentaries.

Whenever a new feature is to be tagged in the text, the text file is re-opened and the new feature 
added, and every time a file is thus enhanced, it is vulnerable to inadvertent alteration (i.e., 
corruption).
In stand-off  markup and annotation, the coded comments, instructions, and qualifications are 
created in separate files which index but do not change the base text file. Once the base text file is 
created and proofed and merged into a CorTex, it is locked down and used as an anchor for tagging 
purposes. Every time that textual analysis reveals a new feature to be tagged, a new stand-off  tag-file 
is associated to the CorTex.
There are at least three advantages of  stand-off  over in-line tagging:
•
the base text is never vulnerable to inadvertent human intervention–its integrity is protected by 
an authenticating checksum and by the fact that enhancement does not involve changing the 
text file.
•
as a result, any number of  people can tag the same base text and offer their added value to a 
growing body of  scholarship related to that document text file. It will not matter which of  the 
distributed copies of  the CorTex is used for tagging; the results will be equally associated with 
all of  them.
•
it provides one solution to the problem of  overlapping hierarchies created by markup systems 
with OHCO (Ordered Hierarchy of  Content Objects) design, in which every part of  a file 
belongs to a single hierarchical arrangement as is the case with HTML and XML. Famously, 
literary texts do not conform to a single hierarchy of  objects: sentences overlap pages, 
syntactical units overlap stanza breaks, etc.

19
. Common to every 
one of  these projects and organizations has been a commitment to in-line tagging of  texts, though 
Talia is developing stand-off  markup and stand-off  markup is being talked about again at Digital 
Humanities Conferences. With the exception of  TextGrid and InterEdition, these projects are ring-
fenced to protect the integrity of  project files. TextGrid is experimenting with a Wiki approach 
which erects a gateway for vetting all contributions. That is a considerable advance over typical 
individual electronic projects that create finished projects in the “look but don’t touch” tradition of  
printed books but also rejects the openness of  the Internet. These are the structural and procedural 
weaknesses of  current standard practice that are addressed in our project and that so powerfully 
restrict engagement with creative works online.
5. Conclusions
E-Carrel is an ambitious software environment aimed at providing robust support to archives and 
critical editions, which presently lack robust and genuinely collaborative tools support. Although at 
an early stage of  development, a subset of  the E-Carrel has been incorporated and demonstrated via 
the WoolfOnline project. CorTex (based on Schmidt’s work on Multi-versioned Documents) is a 
available as an open source project via the Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities web 
site.

 CaTT is available in demonstration form via the WoolfOnline project.
