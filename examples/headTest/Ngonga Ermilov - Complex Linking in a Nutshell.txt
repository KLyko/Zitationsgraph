Abstract.  The Web of Data is growing at a stunning rate. Yet, the per-
centage of statements that are links between knowledge bases remains
remarkably low. This is partly due to the process of specifying links be-
tween knowledge bases being so tedious. In this demo, we present the
COLANUT interface, an intelligent interface that can suggest link spec-
ifications and allows to edit them graphically. We present the different
steps from specifying the knowledge bases that are to be linked to a
semi-automatically generated link specification.
