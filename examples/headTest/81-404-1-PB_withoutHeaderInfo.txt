Abstract
Text curation, like most human endeavors, requires tools. A technique developed for the MONK 
Project, schema harvesting, provides a useful platform for facilitating the digital conversion and 
curation of  text corpora. The author describes Abbot, an XSLT-based application that has had 
success in converting various Text Creation Partnership collections, and others, during and after 
MONK.
