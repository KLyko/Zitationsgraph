In this paper, we present a Web-based interface for editing 
visually complex documents, such as modern authorial 
manuscripts. Applying spatial hypertext theory as the basis for 
designing this interface enables us to facilitate both interaction 
with the visually complex structure of these documents and 
integration of heterogeneous sources of external information. 
This represents a new paradigm for designing systems to 
support digital textual studies. Our approach emphasizes the 
visual nature of texts and provides powerful tools to support 
interpretation and creativity. In contrast to purely image-based 
systems, we are able to do this while retaining the benefi ts of 
traditional textual analysis tools. 
Introduction
Documents express information as a combination of written 
words, graphical elements, and the arrangement of these 
content objects in a particular media. Digital representations of 
documents—and the applications built around them—typically 
divide information between primarily textual representations 
on the one hand (e.g., XML encoded documents) and primarily 
graphical based representations on the other (e.g., facsimiles). 
Image-based representations allow readers access to high-
quality facsimiles of the original document, but provide little 
support for explicitly encoded knowledge about the document. 
XML-based representations, by contrast, are able to specify 
detailed semantic knowledge embodied by encoding guidelines 
such as the TEI [Sperberg-McQueen 2003]. This knowledge 
forms the basis for building sophisticated analysis tools and 
developing rich hypertext interfaces to large document 
collections and supporting materials. This added power comes 
at a price. These approaches are limited by the need to specify 
all relevant content explicitly. This is, at best, a time consuming 
and expensive task and, at worst, an impossible one [Robinson 
2000]. Furthermore, in typical systems, access to these texts

mediated almost exclusively by the transcribed linguistic 
content, even when images alongside their transcriptions. 
By adopting spatial hypertext as a metaphor for representing 
document structure, we are able to design a system that 
emphasizes the visually construed contents of a document 
while retaining access to structured semantic information 
embodied in XML-based representations. Dominant 
hypertext systems, such as the Web, express document 
relationships via explicit links. In contrast, spatial hypertext 
expresses relationships by placing related content nodes near 
each other on a two-dimensional canvas [Marshall 1993]. In 
addition to spatial proximity, spatial hypertext systems express 
relationships through visual properties such as background 
color, border color and style, shape, and font style. Common 
features of spatial hypermedia systems include parsers capable 
of recognizing relationships between objects such as lists, 
list headings, and stacks, structured metadata attributes for 
objects, search capability, navigational linking, and the ability 
to follow the evolution of the information space via a history 
mechanism.
The spatial hypertext model has an intuitive appeal for 
representing visually complex documents. According to this 
model, documents specify relationships between content 
objects (visual representations of words and graphical elements) 
based on their spatial proximity and visual similarity. This allows 
expression of informal, implicit, and ambiguous relationships—
a key requirement for humanities scholarship. Unlike purely 
image-based representations, spatial hypertext enables users 
to add formal descriptions of content objects and document 
structure incrementally in the form of structured metadata 
(including transcriptions and markup). Hypermedia theorists 
refer to this process as “incremental formalism” [Shipman 
1999]. Once added, these formal descriptions facilitate system 
support for text analysis and navigational hypertext. 
Another key advantage of spatial hypertext is its ability to 
support “information triage” [Marshall 1997]. Information 
triage is the process of locating, organizing, and prioritizing large 
amounts of heterogeneous information. This is particularly 
helpful in supporting information analysis and decision making 
in situations where the volume of information available makes 
detailed evaluation of it each resource impossible. By allowing 
users to rearrange objects freely in a two-dimensional 
workspace, spatial hypertext systems provide a lightweight 
interface for organizing large amounts of information. In 
addition to content taken directly from document images, 
this model encourages the inclusion of visual surrogates for 
information drawn from numerous sources. These include 
related photographs and artwork, editorial annotations, links 
to related documents, and bibliographical references. Editors/
readers can then arrange this related material as they interact 
with the document to refi ne their interpretive perspective. 
Editors/readers are also able to supply their own notes and 
graphical annotations to enrich the workspace further. 
System Design
We are developing CritSpace as a proof of concept system 
using the spatial hypertext metaphor as a basis for supporting 
digital textual studies. Building this system from scratch, rather 
than using an existing application, allows us to tailor the 
design to meet needs specifi c to the textual studies domain 
(for example, by including document image analysis tools). We 
are also able to develop this application with a Web-based 
interface tightly integrated with a digital archive containing 
a large volume of supporting information (such as artwork, 
biographical information, and bibliographic references) as well 
as the primary documents. 
Initially, our focus is on a collection of manuscript documents 
written by Picasso [Audenaert 2007]. Picasso’s prominent use 
of visual elements, their tight integration with the linguistic 
content, and his reliance on ambiguity and spatial arrangement 
to convey meaning make this collection particularly attractive 
[Marin 1993, Michaël 2002]. These features also make his work 
particularly diffi cult to represent using XML-based approaches. 
More importantly, Picasso’s writings contain numerous features 
that exemplify the broader category of modern manuscripts 
including documents in multiple states, extensive authorial 
revisions, editorial drafts, interlinear and marginal scholia, and 
sketches and doodles.

along with several related preparatory sketches 
Picasso made for Guernica about the same time.
CritSpace provides an HTML based interface for accessing the 
collection maintained by the Picasso Project [Mallen 2007] that 
contains nearly 14,000 artworks (including documents) and 
9,500 biographical entries. CritSpace allows users to arrange 
facsimile document images in a two dimensional workspace 
and resize and crop these images. Users may also search 
and browse the entire holdings of the digital library directly 
from CritSpace, adding related artworks and biographical 
information to the workspace as desired. In addition to content 
taken from the digital library, users may add links to other

material available on the Web, or add their own comments to 
the workspace in the form of annotations. All of these items 
are displayed as content nodes that can be freely positioned 
and whose visual properties can be modifi ed. Figure 1 shows 
a screenshot of this application that displays a document and 
several related artworks.
CritSpace also introduces several features tailored to support 
digital textual studies. A tab at the bottom of the display opens 
a window containing a transcription of the currently selected 
item. An accordion-style menu on the right hand side provides 
a clipboard for temporarily storing content while rearranging 
the workspace, an area for working with groups of images, and 
a panel for displaying metadata and browsing the collection 
based on this metadata. We also introduce a full document 
mode that allows users to view a high-resolution facsimile. 
This interface allows users to add annotations (both shapes 
and text) to the image and provides a zooming interface to 
facilitate close examination of details. 
Future Work
CritSpace provides a solid foundation for understanding how 
to apply spatial hypertext as a metaphor for interacting with 
visually complex documents. This perspective opens numerous 
directions for further research. 
A key challenge is developing tools to help identify content 
objects within a document and then to extracted these object 
in a way that will allow users to manipulate them in the visual 
workspace. Along these lines, we are working to adapt existing 
techniques for foreground/background segmentation [Gatos 
2004], word and line identifi cation [Manmatha 2005], and 
page segmentation [Shafait 2006]. We are investigating the 
use of Markov chains to align transcriptions to images semi-
automatically [Rothfeder 2006] and expectation maximization 
to automatically recognize dominant colors for the purpose of 
separating information layers (for example, corrections made 
in red ink). 
Current implementations of these tools require extensive 
parameter tuning by individuals with a detailed understanding 
of the image processing algorithms. We plan to investigate 
interfaces that will allow non-experts to perform this 
parameter tuning interactively. 
Modern spatial hypertext applications include a representation 
of the history of the workspace [Shipman 2001]. We are 
interested in incorporating this notion, to represent documents, 
not as fi xed and fi nal objects, but rather objects that have 
changed over time. This history mechanism will enable editors 
to reconstruct hypothetical changes to the document as 
authors and annotators have modifi ed it. It can also be used to 
allowing readers to see the changes made by an editor while 
constructing a particular form of the document.
While spatial hypertext provides a powerful model for 
representing a single workspace, textual scholars will need 
tools to support the higher-level structure found in documents, 
such as chapters, sections, books, volumes. Further work is 
needed to identify ways in which existing spatial hypertext 
models can be extended express relationships between these 
structures and support navigation, visualization, and editing.
Discussion
Spatial hypertext offers an alternative to the dominate 
view of text as an “ordered hierarchy of content objects” 
(OCHO) [DeRose 1990]. The OCHO model emphasizes the 
linear, linguistic content of a document and requires explicit 
formalization of structural and semantic relationships early 
in the encoding process. For documents characterized by 
visually constructed information or complex and ambiguous 
structures, OCHO may be overly restrictive. 
In these cases, the ability to represent content objects 
graphically in a two dimensional space provides scholars the 
fl exibility to represent both the visual aspects of the text they 
are studying and the ambiguous, multi-facetted relationships 
found in those texts. Furthermore, by including an incremental 
path toward the explicit encoding of document content, this 
model enables the incorporation of advanced textual analysis 
tools that can leverage both the formally specifi ed structure 
and the spatial arrangement of the content objects.
