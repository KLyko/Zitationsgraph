This study proposes a multivariate approach to the collocation 
of gentleman in Dickens. By applying a stylo-statistical analysis 
model based on correspondence analysis (Tabata, 2004, 2005, 
2007a, and 2007b) to the investigation of the collocation 
of the word gentleman, the present study visualizes the 
complex interrelationships among gentleman’s collocates, 
interrelationships among texts, and the association patterns 
between the gentleman’s collocates and texts in multi-
dimensional spaces. By so doing, I shall illustrate how the 
collocational patterns of gentleman refl ects a stylistic variation 
over time as well as the stylistic fi ngerprint of the author.
One thing that strikes readers of Dickens in terms of his style 
is the ways he combines words together (i.e. collocation). 
Dickens sometimes combines words in a quite unique manner, 
in a way that contradicts our expectation to strike humour, to 
imply irony or satire, or otherwise. Dickens also uses fi xed/
repetitive collocations for characterization: to make particular 
characters memorable by making them stand out from others. 
The collocation of word gentleman, one of the most frequent 
‘content’ words in Dickens, is full of such examples, and would 
therefore be worthy of stylistic investigation.
The signifi cance of collocation in stylistic studies was fi rst 
suggested by J. R. Firth (1957) more than half a century ago. 
Thanks to the efforts by Sinclair (1991) and his followers, 
who have developed empirical methodologies based on large-
scale corpora, the study of collocation has become widely 
acknowledged as an important area of linguistics. However, 
the vast majority of collocation studies (Sinclair, 1991; 
Kjellmer, 1994; Stubbs, 1995; Hunston and Francis, 1999, to 
name but a few) have been concerned with grammar/syntax, 
lexicography, and language pedagogy, not with stylistic aspects 
of collocation, by showing the company a word keeps. Notable 
exceptions are Louw (1993), Adolphs and Carter (2003), Hori 
(2004), and Partington (2006). The emergence of these recent 
studies seems to indicate that collocation is beginning to draw 
increasing attention from stylisticians. 
Major tools used for collocation studies are KWIC 
concordances and statistical measures, which have been 
designed to quantify collocational strength between words 
in texts. With the wide availability of highly functional 
concordancers, it is now conventional practice to examine 
collocates in a span of, say, four words to the left, and four 
words to the right, of the node (target word/key word) with 
the help of statistics for fi ltering out unimportant information. 
This conventional approach makes it possible to detect a 
grammatical/syntactic, phraseological, and/or semantic relation 
between the node and its collocates. However, a conventional 
approach would not be suitable if one wanted to explore 
whether the company a word keeps would remain unchanged, 
or its collocation would change over time or across texts. It 
is unsuitable because this would involve too many variables to 
process with a concordancer to include a diachronic or a cross-
textual/authorial perspective when retrieving collocational 
information from a large set of texts. Such an enterprise would 
require a multivariate approach.
Various multivariate analyses of texts have been successful 
in elucidating linguistic variation over time, variation across 
registers, variation across oceans, to say nothing of linguistic 
differences between authors (Brainerd, 1980; Burrows, 1987 
& 1996; Biber and Finegan, 1992; Craig, 1999a, b, & c; Hoover, 
2003a, b, & c; Rudman, 2005). My earlier attempts used 
correspondence analysis to accommodate low frequency 
variables (words) in profi ling authorial/chronological/cross-
register variations in Dickens and Smollett (Tabata, 2005, 
2007a, & c). Given the fact that most collocates of content 
words tend to be low in frequency, my methodology based 
on correspondence analysis would usefully be applied to a 
macroscopic analysis of collocation of gentleman.
This study uses Smollett’s texts as a control set against which 
the Dickens data is compared, in keeping with my earlier 
investigations. Dickens and Smollett stand in contrast in the 
frequency of gentleman. In 23 Dickens texts used in this study, 
the number of tokens for gentleman amounts to 4,547, whereas 
Smollett employs them 797 times in his seven works. In the 
normalised frequency scale per million words, the frequency 
in Dickens is 961.2, while the frequency in Smollett is 714.3. 
However, if one compares the fi rst seven Dickens texts with 
the Smollett set, the discrepancy is even greater: 1792.0 versus 
714.33 per million words. The word gentleman is signifi cantly 
more frequent in early Dickens than in his later works.
Stubbs (2001: 29) states that “[t]here is some consensus, but 
no total agreement, that signifi cant collocates are usually found 
within a span of 4:4”. Following the conventional practice to 
examine collocation (Sinclaire, 1991; Stubbs, 1995 & 2001), the 
present study deals with words occurring within a span of four 
words prior to, and four words following, the node (gentleman) 
as variables (collocates) to be fed into correspondence 
analysis.
The respective frequency of each collocate is arrayed to form 
the frequency-profi le for 29 texts (Smollett’s The Adventure of 
an Atom is left out of the data set since it contains no instance of 
gentleman). The set of 29 collocate frequency profi les (collocate 
frequency matrix) is then transposed and submitted to 
correspondence analysis (CA), a technique for data-reduction. 
CA allows examination of the complex interrelationships 
between row cases (i.e., texts), interrelationships between 
column variables (i.e., collocates), and association between 
the row cases and column variables graphically in a multi-
dimensional space. It computes the row coordinates (word

scores) and column coordinates (text scores) in a way that 
permutes the original data matrix so that the correlation 
between the word variables and text profi les are maximized. 
In a permuted data matrix, adverbs with a similar pattern of 
distribution make the closest neighbours, and so do texts of 
similar profi le. When the row/column scores are projected in 
multi-dimensional charts, relative distance between variable 
entries indicates affi nity, similarity, association, or otherwise 
between them.
Figure 1. Correspondance analysis of the 
collocates of gentleman: Text-map
Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate a result of correspondence 
analysis based on 1,074 collocates of gentleman across 29 
texts. The horizontal axis of Figure 1 labelled as Dimension 
1, the most powerful axis, visualizes the difference between 
the two authors in the distribution of gentleman’s collocates. 
It is also interesting that the early Dickensian texts, written in 
1830s and early 1840s, are lying towards the bottom half of the 
diagram. The same holds true for Smollett. Thus, the horizontal 
axis can be interpreted as indicating authorial variation in the 
collocation of gentleman, whereas the vertical axis can be 
interpreted as representing variation over time, although text 
entries do not fi nd themselves in an exact chronological order. 
On the other hand, Figure 2 is too densely populated to identify 
each collocate, except for the outlying collocates, collocates 
with stronger “pulling power”. However, it would be possible 
to make up for this by inspecting a diagram derived from 
much smaller number of variables (say, 100 variables, which 
will be shown shortly as Figure 4), whose overall confi guration 
is remarkably similar to Figure 2 despite the decrease in the 
number of variables computed.
Figure 2. Correspondence analysis of the collocates 
of gentleman: A galaxy of collocates
The Dickens corpus is more than four times the size of the 
Smollett corpus, and the number of types as well as tokens 
of gentleman’s collocates in Dickens is more than four times 
as many as those in Smollett. It is necessary to ensure that 
a size factor does not come into play in the outcome of 
analysis. Figures 3 and 4 are derived from the variables of 100 
collocates common to both authors. Despite the decrease in 
the number of variables from 1,074 to 100, the confi guration 
of texts and words is remarkably similar to that based on 
1,074 items. The Dickens set and the Smollett set, once again, 
can be distinguished from each other along Dimension 1. 
Moreover, in each of the two authors’ sets, early works tend 
to have lower scores with later works scoring higher along 
Dimension 2. The results of the present analysis is consistent 
with my earlier studies based on different variables, such as –ly 
adverbs, superlatives, as well as high-frequency function words. 
It would be possible to assume that authorial fi ngerprints 
are as fi rmly set in the collocation of gentleman as in other 
component of vocabulary. These results seem to illustrate 
multivariate analysis of collocates could provide interesting 
new perspectives to the study of collocation.
