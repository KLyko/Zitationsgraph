Other to Self-Transcendence 
and Transformation

The aim of this paper is to establish a model for the 
relationship between the player of a video game and the avatar 
that represents that player in the virtual world of the video 
game. I propose that there is an evolution in the identifi cation 
of the player of a video game with the avatar character that 
performs embodied actions in the virtual world of the game. 
This identifi cation can be described through an examination of 
theories from a variety of subject areas including philosophy, 
literary studies, video game theory, and educational theory. 
Specifi cally, theories in hermeneutics, literary immersion, 
embodiment, empathy, narrative, game ego, play, and learning 
theory are synthesized to produce a broad picture of the 
player/avatar relationship as it develops over time. I will 
identify stages in the process of feeling immersed in a game. 
This feeling of immersion can, but may not necessarily will, 
occur as the player engages in game play over a period of 
time. I will identify this process in stages: “other”; “embodied 
empathy”; “self-transcendence”; and “transformation.” At the 
fi nal stage, the game play can offer a critique of the player’s 
worldview, to call into question the player’s approach and even 
presuppositions about the world. I suggest here, the player 
no longer sees the avatar as an “other” a character to be 
understood in some way, and not as some virtual representation 
of the self, something apart from himself, and not even as some 
sort of virtual embodiment of himself. I suggest that the player 
transcends even the avatar as any sort of representation, that 
the avatar disappears from the consciousness of the player 
altogether. A result of this critique is a transformation that 
takes place within the player that may actually transform one’s 
self-understanding, thus providing the player with an authentic 
learning experience.
There is a sense of embodiment that goes along with controlling 
an avatar in a virtual world that, I believe, is not present when 
becoming immersed in a fi lm or a book. In a video game, the 
player’s actions have direct and immediate consequences 
in terms of reward or punishment as well as movement 
through the virtual world. The narrative effect helps drive the 
character through this reward and punishment. The idea of 
affordances is often used in terms of game design and the use 
of emotional affordances to help propel the player into the 
virtual environment. Thus, with a video game, there is a more 
complete immersion into the constructed imaginary world—
an embodied immersion and an emotional immersion.
I would like to clarify the defi nition of this feeling of immersion 
that happens as a video game progresses. Various terms are 
used in the fi elds of literary analysis, psychology, video game

theory, and philosophy. Terms like literary transport, fl ow, 
presence, immersion, identifi cation, and self-transcendence 
are often used to describe the feeling of the self moving out 
of the real world and into a constructed imaginary world. 
I use Janet Murray’s offers a commonly accepted defi nition 
used in the gaming industry for this term, a sense of being 
physically submerged in water (Murray 1997, p. 99). My goal 
here is to illuminate the idea that there is a process to gaining 
this feeling of immersion. The player proceeds step-by-step 
into the game world. The work of Gallagher in philosophy 
of mind acknowledges that there is a growth process that 
takes place in developing an understanding of other people, 
through primary and secondary interaction. Gallese offers an 
alternative argument that the biological basis of this growth 
in understanding happen initially as a neural response from 
the mirror neuron system, then as a more mature empathetic 
response. Ultimately, I would like to establish a sequence that 
combines the work of Gallese and Gallagher with the work 
of digital narrative theorists Ryan and Murray. The sequence 
of immersion could be stated as: other→empathy→self-
transcendence→transformation.
The fi rst stage of approaching the avatar is learning the 
mechanics of the game. In this stage the player sees the avatar 
as “other,” as an awkward and theoretical representation of the 
self. Initially, the avatar is a picture or symbol for the self. The 
player learns to manipulate the keyboard, mouse, or controller. 
The avatar is “other,” a foreign virtual object that must be 
awkwardly manipulated by the player. In this stage there is little 
personal identifi cation with the avatar, except on a theoretical 
level. The avatar cannot function effi ciently according to the 
will of the player, but operates as a cumbersome vehicle for 
the player’s intentions.
I propose that the player in the second stage the player begins 
to view the avatar as a character in a world, and the player 
begins to empathize with the character in a novel or in a fi lm. 
Let me clarify, here, that at this stage the avatar is still viewed 
as Other, but a component of empathy now emerges through 
the use of narrative. The player now has learned to effectively 
manipulate the character, to move the character through the 
virtual world. I believe, here, embodiment plays an important 
biological role in helping to establish this feeling of empathy 
for the character. There is also an important component of 
narrative that drives the player toward empathy with the 
avatar. The work of Marie-Laure Ryan is an important theoriest 
in this area.
In the third stage, which I call “self-transcendence,” the player 
experiences full identifi cation with the avatar, not as empathizing 
with another character, but embodying the actions and world 
of the avatar as if it were his own. On this point, I will refer to 
Gadamer’s idea of the self-transcendence of play as well as his 
article “The Relevance of the Beautiful” and several authors 
working on the concept of immersion and game ego in video 
game theory (Murray, Wilhelmsson, Ryan). The literature 
on video game theory uses the terms immersion, fl ow, and 
presence in a similar way, but I feel Gadamer’s term “self-
transcendence” more aptly fi ts the description I will offer.
At the point of self-transcendence, transformation can happen. 
Learning theory and the philosophy of hermeneutics, especially 
as stated in the work of Gallagher in Hermeneutics and 
Education and the hermeneutic theories of Gadamer 
(specifi cally his fusion of horizons), can establish how 
understanding happens and how transformation of the self can 
take place more completely in the virtually embodied world 
of video games.
