 For the most part, digital scholarly editions have been 
historically grown constructs. In most cases, they are oriented 
toward print editions, especially if they are retro-digitized. But 
even “digital-born” editions often follow the same conventions 
as printed books. A further problem is that editors start to 
work on a scholarly edition without enough previous in-depth 
analysis about how to structure information for electronic 
research. In the course of editing and the collection of data, the 
requirements and wishes of how the edited texts should be 
presented frequently changes, especially when the editor does 
not have a chance to “see” the edition before it is complete. 
Usually all the data is collected, the text is edited and the last 
step is to think about the different presentation formats.
One of the fi rst steps in the production of a digital scholarly 
edition should be to analyze what kind of information might 
be of interest to a broad audience, and how this should 
be structured so that it can be searched and displayed 
appropriately. The crucial point in the process of designing the 
data structure should be that different scholars have different 
intellectual requirements from resources. They are not always 
happy with how editors organize scholarly editions.
Michael Sperberg-McQueen demanded in 1994, “Electronic 
scholarly editions should be accessible to the broadest 
audience possible.”[1] However, current scholarly editions are 
produced for a certain audience with very specialized research 
interests. The great potential of a digital scholarly edition is 
that it can be designed fl exibly enough to meet the demands 
of people with many different viewpoints and interests. So why 
not let the audience make the decision as to which information 
is relevant and which is not? Some information might be of 
more interest, other information of less interest or could be 
entirely ignorable.
Imagine a critical scholarly edition about medicine in ancient 
Greece provided by editors with a philological background. 
A philologist has different needs relating to this edition than, 
e.g., a medical historian, who might not be able to read Greek 
and might be only interested in reading about ancient medical 
practices. Who knows what kinds of annotations within the 
text are of interest for the recipients?
The digital world provides us with many possibilities to 
improve scholarly editions, such as almost unlimited space to 
give complete information, more fl exibility in organizing and 
presenting information, querying information, instant feedback 
and a range of other features.
We have to think about how we can use these benefi ts to 
establish a (perhaps formalized) workfl ow to give scholars 
the chance to validate their work while it is in progress and 
to present their work in progress in an appropriate way for 
discussion within a community. This would not just validate 
the technical form of the work, but also improve the quality of 
the content, often due to ongoing feedback, and improve the 
intellectual benefi ts.
On the other hand, digital editions should be brought online 
in an easy way without weeks of planning and months of 
developing software that may fi t the basic needs of the editors 
but in most cases is just re-inventing the wheel. If needed, 
digitized images should be included easily and must be citeable. 
As it might be about work in progress, all stages of work must 
be saved and documented. Therefore, a versioning system is 
needed that allows referencing of all work steps.
Finally, it is necessary that the scholar is able to check his or 
her work viewed in various media by the click of a button - for 
example, how the edition looks like on screen or printed, or 
even with different layouts or website designs.
What is the potential of such a system? It offers an easy way 
to present the current state of a work in progress. Scholars 
can check their work at any time. But this is not useful without 
modifi cations for the special needs of certain digital editions 
and special navigation issues. Nevertheless, it can be used as 
base system extensible by own scripts, which implement the 
needs of a concrete project.
And last but not least, such a system should offer the possibility 
of re-using data that is based on the same standard for other 
projects. This is especially true for more formalized data, such 
as biographical or bibliographical information, which could be 
used across different projects that concern the same issue or 
the same period.
This paper will give a practical example of what an architecture 
that follows the aforementioned demands would look like. 
This architecture gives scholars the possibility of producing 
a scholarly edition using open standards. The texts can be 
encoded directly in XML or using WYSIWYG-like methods, 
such as possible with the oXygen XML editor or WORD XML 
exports.
The “Scalable Architecture for Digital Editions” (SADE) 
developed at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences 
and Humanities is a modular and freely scalable system that 
can be adapted by different projects that follow the guidelines 
of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)[2] or easily use other XML 
standards as input formats. Using the TEI is more convenient, 
as less work in the modifi cation of the existing XQuery and 
XSLT scripts needs to be done.

Scalability of SADE relates to the server side as well as to 
the browser side. Browser-side scalability is equivalent to the 
users’ needs or research interests. The user is able to arrange 
the information output as he or she likes. Information can be 
switched on or off. The technological base for this functionality 
is AJAX or the so-called Web 2.0 technologies.
Server-side scalability is everything that has to do with 
querying the database and transforming the query results into 
HTML or PDF. As eXist[3], the database we use, is a native 
XML database, the whole work can be done by XML-related 
technologies such as XQuery and XSLT. These scripts can be 
adapted with less effort to most projects’ needs.
For the connection between text and digitized facsimile, SADE 
uses Digilib[4], an open-source software tool jointly developed 
by the Max-Planck-Insitute for the History of Science, the 
University of Bern and others. Digilib is not just a tool for 
displaying images, but rather a tool that provides basic image 
editing functions and the capability of marking certain points 
in the image for citation. The versioning system at the moment 
is still a work in progress, but will be available by conference 
time.
Documents can be queried in several ways - on the one hand 
with a standard full text search in texts written in Latin or 
Greek letters, and on the other hand by using a more complex 
interface to query structured elements, such as paragraphs, 
names, places, the apparatus, etc. These query options are 
provided by SADE. Furthermore, all XML documents are 
available not rendered in raw XML format, and so can be 
integrated in different projects rendered in a different way.
SADE could be the next step in improving the acceptance of 
digital editions. Texts are accessible in several ways. The editor 
decisions are transparent and comprehensible at every stage 
of work, which is most important for the intellectual integrity 
of a scholarly edition. The digitized facsimiles can be referenced 
and therefore be discussed scientifi cally. The database back end 
is easy to handle and easy to adapt to most projects’ needs.
A working example, which is work in progress and extended 
continually, is the website of the “Corpus Medicorum 
Graecorum / Latinorum”[5] long term academy project at the 
Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities[6]. 
This website exemplifi es how a recipient can organize which 
information is relevant for his or her information retrieval.
