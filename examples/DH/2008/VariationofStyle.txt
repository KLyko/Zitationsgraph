Introduction
Among works, devoted to the quantitative study of style, 
an approach prevails which can be conventionally called as 
synchronic. Synchronic approach is aimed at solving various 
classifi cation problems (including those of attribution), making 
use of average (mean) values of characteristics, which refl ect 
the style of the whole creative activity of an author. This 
approach is based on the assumption that the features of an 
individual style are not changing during lifetime or vary in time 
very little, due to which the changes can be disregarded as 
linguistically irrelevant. 
This assumption can be tested in experiments, organised 
within a diachronic approach, whose purpose is to compare 
linguistic properties of texts, written by the same author at 
different periods of his life.
This paper presents the results of such a diachronic study 
of the individual style of famous American romantic poet 
E.A.Poe. The study was aimed at fi nding out whether there 
were linguistically relevant differences in the style of the poet 
at various periods of his creative activity and if so, at revealing 
linguistic markers for the transition from one period to the 
other.
Material
The material includes iambic lyrics published by Poe in his 4 
collections of poems. Lyrics were chosen because this genre 
expresses in the most vivid way the essential characteristics of 
a poet. In order to achieve a common basis for the comparison 
only iambic texts were taken, they usually did not exceed 60 
lines. It should be noted that iamb was used by Poe in most of 
his verses. Sonnets were not taken for analysis because they 
possess specifi c structural organization. Poe’s life is divided 
into three periods: (1) from Poe’s fi rst attempts to write 
verses approximately in 1824 till 1829, (2) from 1830 till 1835 
and (3) from 1836 till 1849. 
Characteristics
For the analysis 27 characteristics were taken. They include 
morphological and syntactic parameters.
Morphological characteristics are formulated in terms of 
traditional morphological classes (noun, verb, adjective, 
adverb and pronoun). We counted how many times each of 
them occurs in the fi rst and the fi nal strong (predominantly 
stressed) syllabic positions – ictuses.
Most of syntactic characteristics are based on the use of 
traditional notions of the members of the sentence (subject, 
predicate, object, adverbial modifi er) in the fi rst and the fi nal 
strong positions in poems. Other syntactic parameters are 
the number of clauses in (a) complex and (b) compound 
sentences. 
There are also several characteristics which represent what 
can be called as poetical syntax. They are the number of 
enjambements, the number of lines divided by syntactic pauses 
and the number of lines, ending in exclamation or question 
marks. Enjambement takes place when a clause is continued 
on the next line (And what is not a dream by day / To him 
whose eyes are cast / On things around him <…>). Pause is 
a break in a line, caused by a subordinate clause or another 
sentence (I feel ye now – I feel ye in your strength – <…>).
The values of the characteristics, which were obtained as a 
result of the analysis of lyrics, were normalised over the size 
of these texts in lines.
Method
One of multivariate methods of statistical analyses – 
discriminant analysis – was used. This method has been 
successfully used in the study of literary texts for authorship 
detection (Stamatatos, Fakatakis and Kokkinakis 2001; Baayen, 
Van Halteren, and Tweedie 1996, etc.), genre differentiation 
(Karlgen, Cutting 1994; Minori Murata 2000, etc.), gender 
categorization (Koppel et al. 2002; Olsen 2005), etc.
Discriminant analysis is a procedure whose purpose is to fi nd 
characteristics, discriminating between naturally occurring 
(or a priori formed) classes, and to classify into these 
classes separate (unique) cases which are often doubtful and 
“borderline”. For this purpose linear functions are calculated in 
such a way as to provide the best differentiation between the 
classes. The variables of these functions are characteristics of 
objects, relevant for discrimination. Judging by the coeffi cients 
of these variables we can single out the parameters which 
possess maximum discriminating force. Besides, the procedure 
enables us to test the statistical signifi cance of the obtained 
results (Klecka, 1989).
In this paper discriminant analysis is used to fi nd out if there is 
any difference between groups of texts written during Periods 
1–3, reveal characteristics differentiating these text groups and 
establish their discriminating force.
Results
It would be natural to expect that due to Poe’s relatively short 
period of creative activity (his fi rst collection of poems was 
published in 1827, his last collection – in 1845) his individual style 
does not vary much, if at all. Nevertheless the results show that 
there are clearly marked linguistic differences between his texts

written during these three periods. Out of 27 characteristics, 
used in the analysis, 14 proved to possess discriminating force, 
distinguishing between the verse texts of different periods 
of the author’s life. The strongest discriminating force was 
observed in morphological characteristics of words both in 
the fi rst and fi nal strong positions and syntactic characteristics 
of the initial part of verse lines. These parameters may be used 
for automatic classifi cation of Poe’s lyrics into three groups 
corresponding to three periods of his creative activity with 
100% correctness. 
The transition from the fi rst to the second period is mainly 
characterised by changes in the number of verbs, nouns and 
pronouns in the fi rst and the last strong positions, as well as 
in the number of subordinate clauses in complex sentences, 
words in the function of adverbial modifi er in the initial position 
in the line. The development in Poe’s style from the second to 
the third period is also marked by changes in the number of 
morphological classes of words in the initial and fi nal strong 
positions of the line (nouns, adverbs and pronouns). 
It should be stressed that these changes refl ect general 
tendencies of variation of frequencies of certain elements and 
are not present in all the texts. In the following examples the shift 
of verbs from the fi nal part of the line, which is characteristic 
of the fi rst period, to the initial strong position of the line (i.e. 
second syllable) in the second period is observed.
Period 1
But when within thy waves she looks –
     Which glistens then, and trembles –
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
     Her worshipper resembles –
For in my heart – as in thy streem – 
     Her image deeply lies <...> 
(To the River)
Period 2
You know the most enormous fl ower –
That rose – <...>
I tore it from its pride of place
And shook it into pieces <...>
(Fairy Land)
On the whole the results show that there are certain 
linguistic features which refl ect the changes in the style of 
E.A.Poe. Among important period markers are part of speech 
characteristics and several syntactic parameters.
