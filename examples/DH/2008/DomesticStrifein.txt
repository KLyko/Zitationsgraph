The seventeenth-century engravings and texts collected for 
the project Le mariage sous l’Ancien Régime: une anthologie 
virtuelle all belong to the polemical genre. The institution of 
marriage was undergoing intense scrutiny and criticism in 
light of Reformation questioning of Catholic practices, and 
popular discourse and images refl ected this malaise. The 
cuckold attacked both verbally and physically by a nagging 
wife, or, conversely, a sassy wife receiving her “correction” 
are themes of the Middle Ages reproduced frequently during 
the early modern period, but with new sophistication as 
engravings became the primary site for the representation 
of problems with marriage, as DeJean has shown. Whereas 
polemical writings fl ourished in the fi rst half of the century 
according to Banderier and Carlin 2002, images gained more 
complexity in design and incorporated increasing amounts of 
commentary during the reign of Louis XIV (1661-1715). New 
variations on medieval topics occur, as bourgeois women in 
salons comment on marriage or wrestle with their husbands 
over the pants in the family. A novel twist on spousal confl ict 
appears in engravings such as “L’invention des femmes” 
(Lagniet) and “Operateur céphalique” (Anon.): inspired by the 
Renaissance interest in dissection, the notion that behaviour 
could be modifi ed through radical brain surgery introduces a 
new kind of violence into marriage satire.
From the beginning of the project, our approach to construction 
of the corpus has been based on the ideal that texts and images 
must both be full and equivalent members of the collection. 
Images have been treated as texts, and our goal has been to 
make explicit, in textual annotations, as much of the signifi cant 
information they encode as possible. In this respect, the 
Mariage project is very different from other markup projects 
which integrate images and texts, such as those described in 
Porter 2007; while projects such as Pembroke 25 (Szarmach 
& Hall n.d.) and the Electronic Aelfric integrate images and 
text in sophisticated ways, the images are of manuscript pages, 
and the at the heart of these digital editions is the process of 
transcription. By contrast, while the engravings in the Mariage 
collection may include fairly extensive textual components 
— see, for instance, “Le Fardeau du Menage” (Guérard 1712), 
which incorporates over 60 lines of verse — the text is 
ancillary to the scenes depicted. Thus, the engravings in the 
Mariage project are somewhere on a continuum between the 
page-images of a digital edition of a manuscript, and the images

of artworks in a project such as the On-Line Picasso Project 
(Mallen n.d.).
At the simplest level, marking up the images means transcribing 
and clarifying any text which actually appears on the engravings. 
This makes the text on the images as searchable as that of the 
poetry and prose. Following this, we have begun to identify and 
discuss the signifi cance of individual fi gures in the engravings, 
as well as linking these fi gures to similar elements in other 
engravings, or to texts in the collection. Figure 1 shows this 
kind of linking in as it appears to the reader in a Web browser. 
The wife’s lover is a recurrent fi gure in images and texts of the 
period, and the annotation links to textual references, and also 
to a segment of another image.

In addition, the search system on the site has been designed to 
retrieve both blocks of text and segments of images, based on 
annotations to the images. Figure 2 shows part of the result 
set from a search for “frapp*”, including sections of images and 
a line from a poem. In the case of an image hit, clicking on the 
link will lead to the annotated image with the “hit annotation” 
selected.

as well as a poem retrieved from the database.
We are now marking up symbols and devices, and have begun 
to contemplate the possibility that we might mark up virtually 
every object which appears in the engravings. Although this 
would be rather laborious, it would enable the discovery of 
more correspondences and perhaps more symbolism than is 
currently apparent. To be able to search for “poule”, and retrieve 
all the depictions of hens which appear in the collection (as well 
as instances of the word itself), and view them together on the 
same page, would provide a powerful tool for researchers. This 
level of annotation (the identifi cation and labelling of everyday 
objects) does not require any signifi cant expertise, but it will 
contribute a great deal to the value of the collection.
Using the combination of textual and image markup, our team 
has been able to uncover links across the decades as well as 
slowly developing differences among diverse types of polemical 
images. Research questions we have begun to explore include 
the following:
- How does the use of key vocabulary evolve over the 
sixteenth to eighteenth centuries?
- How does the use of objects, especially the instruments of 
violence, change over this period?
- How does the use of stock verses and verse forms 
develop over the course of this period?
In addition to discussing the research tools and insights 
emerging out of the Mariage project, this presentation will 
look at the development of the Image Markup Tool, an open-

source Windows application which was created initially for 
use in the Mariage project, but which is now used in a range 
of other projects as well. The IMT has acquired a number of 
new features in response to the requirements of the Mariage 
project, and is also developing in reaction to changes in TEI P5. 
The original approach of the IMT was to blend SVG with TEI 
to produce a dual-namespace document (Carlin, Haswell and 
Holmes 2006), but the incorporation of the new <facsimile>, 
<surface> and <zone> elements in the TEI transcr module (TEI 
Consortium 2007, 11.1) now provide a native TEI framework 
which appears suited to image markup projects such as 
Mariage, and in December 2007, a new version of the Image 
Markup Tool was released, which relinquishes the SVG-based 
approach in favour of a pure TEI schema. This simplifi cation 
of the fi le format will, we hope, make it much easier for end-
users to integrate markup produced using the IMT into Web 
applications and other projects.
Further developments in the IMT are projected over the next 
few months. The current version of the application is really 
focused on marking up the single, standalone images which 
are central to the Mariage project. However, <facsimile> is 
described in the TEI Guidelines as containing “a representation 
of some written source in the form of a set of images rather 
than as transcribed or encoded text” (TEI Consortium 
2007, 11.1). The IMT really ought to be capable of producing 
documents which contain multiple images, and we plan to 
extend it to make this possible.
