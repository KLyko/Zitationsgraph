This paper demonstrates a web-based, interactive data 
visualisation, allowing users to quickly inspect and browse the 
collocational relationships present in a corpus. The software is 
inspired by tag clouds, fi rst popularised by on-line photograph 
sharing website Flickr (www.fl ickr.com). A paper based on 
a prototype of this Collocate Cloud visualisation was given 
at Digital Resources for the Humanities and Arts 2007. The 
software has since matured, offering new ways of navigating 
and inspecting the source data. It has also been expanded to 
analyse additional corpora, such as the British National Corpus 
(http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/), which will be the focus of this 
talk.
Tag clouds allow the user to browse, rather than search for 
specifi c pieces of information. Flickr encourages its users to 
add tags (keywords) to each photograph uploaded. The tags 
associated with each individual photograph are aggregated; the 
most frequent go on to make the cloud. The cloud consists of 
these tags presented in alphabetical order, with their frequency 
displayed as variation in colour, or more commonly font size. 
Figure 1 is an example of the most popular tags at Flickr:

most popular photograph keywords

The cloud offers two ways to access the information. If the 
user is looking for a specifi c term, the alphabetical ordering 
of the information allows it to be quickly located if present. 
More importantly, as a tool for browsing, frequent tags stand 
out visually, giving the user an immediate overview of the 
data. Clicking on a tag name will display all photographs which 
contain that tag.

The cloud-based visualisation has been successfully applied to 
language. McMaster University’s TAPoR Tools (http://taporware.
mcmaster.ca/) features a ‘Word Cloud’ module, currently in 
beta testing. WMatrix (http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/) can 
compare two corpora by showing log-likelihood results in 
cloud form. In addition to other linguistic metrics, internet 
book seller Amazon provides a word cloud, see fi gure 2.

100 most frequent words in Romeo and Juliet

In this instance a word frequency list is the data source, showing 
the most frequent 100 words. As with the tag cloud, this list 
is alphabetically ordered, the font size being proportionate to 
its frequency of usage. It has all the benefi ts of a tag cloud; in 
this instance clicking on a word will produce a concordance 
of that term.
This method of visualisation and interaction offers another 
tool for corpus linguists. As developer for an online corpus 
project, I have found that the usability and sophistication of 
our tools have been important to our success. Cloud-like 
displays of information would complement our other advanced 
features, such as geographic mapping and transcription 
synchronisation.
The word clouds produced by TAPoR Tools, WMatrix and 
Amazon are, for browsing, an improvement over tabular 
statistical information. There is an opportunity for other 
corpus data to be enhanced by using a cloud. Linguists often 
use collocational information as a tool to examine language 
use. Figure 3 demonstrates a typical corpus tool output:

by Mark Davies, searching for ‘bank’, showing collocates

The data contained in the table lends itself to visualisation as 
a cloud. As with the word cloud, the list of collocates can be 
displayed alphabetically. Co-occurrence frequency, like word 
frequency, can be mapped to font size. This would produce an 
output visually similar to the word cloud. Instead of showing 
all corpus words, they would be limited to those surrounding 
the chosen node word.
Another valuable statistic obtainable via collocates is that of 
collocational strength, the likelihood of two words co-occurring, 
measured here by MI (Mutual Information). Accounting for 
this extra dimension requires an additional visual cue to be 
introduced, one which can convey the continuous data of an MI 
score. This can be solved by varying the colour, or brightness 
of the collocates forming the cloud. The end result is shown 
in fi gure 4:

cloud, showing node word ‘bank’
The collocate cloud inherits all the advantages of previous cloud 
visualisations: a collocate, if known, can be quickly located due 
to the alphabetical nature of the display. Frequently occurring 
collocates stand out, as they are shown in a larger typeface, 
with collocationally strong pairings highlighted using brighter

formatting. Therefore bright, large collocates are likely to be 
of interest, whereas dark, small collocates perhaps less so. 
Hovering the mouse over a collocate will display statistical 
information, co-occurrence frequency and MI score, as one 
would fi nd from the tabular view.
The use of collocational data also presents additional 
possibilities for interaction. A collocate can be clicked upon 
to produce a new cloud, with the previous collocate as the 
new node word. This gives endless possibilities for corpus 
exploration and the investigation of different domains. 
Occurrences of polysemy can be identifi ed and expanded 
upon by following the different collocates. Particular instances 
of usage are traditionally hidden from the user when viewing 
aggregated data, such as the collocate cloud. The solution is to 
allow the user to examine the underlying data by producing 
an optional concordance for each node/collocate pairing 
present. Additionally a KWIC concordance can be generated 
by examining the node word, visualising the collocational 
strength of the surrounding words. These concordance lines 
can even by reordered on the basis of collocational strength, 
in addition to the more traditional options of preceding or 
succeeding words.
This visualisation may be appealing to members of the public, 
or those seeking a more practical introduction to corpus 
linguistics. In teaching use they not only provide analysis, but 
from user feedback, also act as stimulation in creative writing. 
Collocate searches across different corpora or document sets 
may be visualised side by side, facilitating quick identifi cation 
of differences.
While the collocate cloud is not a substitute for raw data, it 
does provide a fast and convenient way to navigate language. 
The ability to generate new clouds from existing collocates 
extends this further. Both this iterative nature and the addition 
of collocational strength information gives these collocate 
clouds greater value for linguistic research than previous cloud 
visualisations.
