If, until the middle of the nineties, the main preoccupation 
of the scholarly editor had been that of conserving as 
faithfully as possible the information contained in the original 
sources, in the last ten years attention has shifted to the 
user’s participation in the production of web content. This 
development has occurred under pressure from the ‘native’ 
forms of digital communication as characterised by the term 
‘Web 2.0’ (Tapscott and Williams, 2006). We are interested in 
harnessing the collaborative power of these new environments 
to create ‘fl uid, co-operative, distributed’ (Robinson 2007: 10) 
digital versions of our textual cultural heritage. The approach 
taken by Hypernietzsche (Barbera, 2007) similarly tries to 
foster collaboration around cultural heritage texts. However, 
while Hypernietzsche focuses on annotation, what we have 
developed is a wiki-inspired environment for documents that 
were previously considered too complex for this kind of 
editing. 
Before explaining how this can work in practice, it is worthwhile 
to refl ect on why it is necessary to change our means of 
editing cultural heritage texts. G.T. Tanselle has recently argued 
(2006) that in the digital medium ‘we still have to confront the 
same issues that editors have struggled with for twenty-fi ve 
hundred years’. That may be true for analysis of the source 
texts themselves, but digitisation does change fundamentally 
both the objectives of editing and the function of the edition. 
For the representation of a text ‘is conditioned by the modes 
of its production and reproduction’ (Segre, 1981). The well-
known editorial method of Lachmann, developed for classical 
texts, and that of the New Bibliography for early printed books, 
both assumed that the text was inherently corrupt and needed 
correction into the single version of a print edition. With 
the advent of the digital medium textual critics ‘discovered 
that texts were more than simply correct or erroneous’ 
(Shillingsburg, 2006: 81). The possibility of representing multiple 
versions or multiple markup perspectives has long been seen 
as an enticing prospect of the digital medium, but attempts to 
achieve this so far have led either to complexity that taxes the 
limitations of markup (Renear, 1997: 121) or to an overload of 
information and a ‘drowning by versions’ (Dalhstrom, 2000). 
It is now generally recognised that written texts can contain 
complexities and subtleties of structure that defeat the power 
of markup alone to represent them (Buzzetti, 2002).
In our talk we would like to present three examples of how 
overlapping structures can be effi ciently edited in a wiki: of 
a modern genetic text in Italian, of a short classical text, the 
‘Sybilline Gospel’, and of a short literary text marked up in 
various ways. Our purpose is to demonstrate the fl exibility of 
the tool and the generality of the underlying algorithm, which 
is not designed for any one type of text or any one type of 
editing. However, because of the limited space, we will only 
describe here the Sibylline Gospel text. This is a particularly 
interesting example, because it not only has a complex 
manuscript tradition but it has also been deliberately altered 
throughout its history like agenetic text.
The Sibylla Tiburtina is an apocalyptic prophecy that describes 
the nine ages of world history up to the Last Judgement. The 
fi rst version of this prophecy, which enjoyed a widespread and 
lasting popularity throughout the whole medieval era, was 
written in Greek in the second half of the 4th century. Of this 
lost text we have an edited Byzantine version, dating from the 
beginning of the 6th century, and several Latin versions, besides 
translations in Old French and German, in oriental languages 
(Syric, Arabic and Ethiopian) and in Slavic and Romanian.
The known Latin manuscripts number approximately 100, 
ranging in date from the mid 11th century to the beginning 
of the 16th. In the course of these centuries, with a particular 
concentration between the 11th and 12th centuries, the text 
was subjected to continuous revisions, in order to adapt it. 
This is demonstrated both by the changing names of eastern 
rulers mentioned in the ninth age, which involves the coming 
of a Last Roman Emperor and of the Antichrist, and by the 
introduction of more strictly theological aspects, especially in 
the so-called ‘Sibylline Gospel’, that is an account of Christ’s 
life presented by the Sibyl under the fourth age. No critical 
edition of the Sibylla Tiburtina based on all its Latin versions 
has yet been produced, although this is the only way to unravel 
the genesis of the text and the history of its successive 
reworkings. A classical type of critical edition, however, would 
not be appropriate, nor would it make sense, to establish a 
critical text in the traditional sense as one ‘cleaned of the 
errors accumulated in the course of its history and presented 
in a form most closely imagined to have been the original’. 
With this kind of representation one would have on the one 
hand the inconvenience of an unwieldy apparatus criticus and 
on the other, the serious inconsistency of a ‘critical’ text that 
never had any real existence.
To handle cases like this, we are well advanced in the 
development of a multi-version document wiki application. 
The multi-version document (or MVD) concept is a further 
development of the variant graph model described at Digital 
Humanities 2006 and elsewhere (Schmidt and Fiormonte, 
2007). In a nutshell the MVD format stores the text as a 
graph that accurately represents a single work in digital form, 
however many versions or markup perspectives it may be 
composed of. An MVD fi le is no mere aggregation of separate 
fi les; it is a single digital entity, within which versions may be 
effi ciently searched and compared. It consists of three parts:

1) The variant-graph consisting of a list of the differences 
between the versions
2) A description of each of the versions, including a short 
name or siglum, e.g. ‘L10’, a longer name e.g. ‘London, Brit. 
Lib. Cotton Titus D.III, saec. XIII’ and a group name.
3) A list of groups. A group is a name for a group of versions 
or other groups. For example, in the Sybilline Gospel 
text there are three recensions, to which each of the 
manuscripts belong. 
The wiki application consists of two JAVA packages (outlined 
in bold):
At the lower level the NMerge package implements all the 
functionality of the MVD format: the searching, comparison, 
retrieval and saving of versions. It can also export an MVD into 
a readable XML form. The text of each version is recorded in 
a simplifi ed form of TEI-XML, but the MVD format does not 
rely on any form of markup, and is equally capable of handling 
binary fi le formats. 
Building on this package, the Phaidros web application provides 
various forms for viewing and searching a multi-version 
document: for comparing two versions, for viewing the text 
alongside its manuscript facsimile, for reading a single version 
or for examining the list of versions. The user may also edit and 
save the XML content of each of these views. Since NMerge 
handles all of the overlapping structures, the markup required 
for each version can be very simple, as in a real wiki. In the 
drawing below the differences between the two versions are 
indicated by underlined or bold text.
This application is suitable for collaborative refi nement of 
texts within a small group of researchers or by a wider public, 
and attempts to extend the idea of the wiki to new classes of 
text and to new classes of user.
