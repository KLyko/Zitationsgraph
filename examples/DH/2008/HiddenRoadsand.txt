While information retrieval (IR) and text analysis in the 
humanities may share many common algorithms and 
technologies, they diverge markedly in their primary objects 
of analysis, use of results, and objectives. IR is designed to 
fi nd documents containing textual information bearing 
on a specifi ed subject, frequently by constructing abstract 
representations of documents or “distancing” the reader from 
texts. Humanistic text analysis, on the other hand, is aimed 
primarily at enhancing understanding of textual information as 
a complement of “close reading” of relatively short passages. 
Interpreting a poem, a novel or a philosophical treatise in the 
context of large digital corpora is, we would argue, a constant 
interplay between the estranging technologies of machine 
learning and the direct reading of passages in a work. A 
signifi cant element of interpreting or understanding a passage 
in a primary text is based on linking its specifi c elements 
to parts of other works, often within a particular temporal 
framework. To paraphrase Harold Bloom, ‘understanding’ 
in humanistic textual scholarship, ‘is the art of knowing the 
hidden roads that go from text to text’. [1] Indeed, situating 
a passage of a text in a wider context of an author’s oeuvre, 
time period, or even larger intellectual tradition, is one of the 
hallmarks of textual hermeneutics.
While fi nding the “hidden roads and twisted paths” between 
texts has always been subject to the limitations of human 
reading and recollection, machine learning and text mining 
offer the tantalizing prospect of making that search easier. 
Computers can sift through ever-growing collections of 
primary documents to help readers fi nd meaningful patterns, 
guiding research and mitigating the frailties of human memory. 
We believe that a combination of supervised and unsupervised 
machine learning approaches can be integrated to propose 
various kinds of passages of potential interest based on the 
passage a reader is examining at a given moment, overcoming 
some limitations of traditional IR tools. One-dimensional 
measures of similarity, such as the single numerical score 
generated by a vector space model, fail to account for the 
diverse ways texts interact. Traditional ‘ranked relevancy 
retrieval’ models assume a single measure of relevance that 
can be expressed as an ordered list of documents, whereas 
real textual objects are composed of smaller divisions that 
each are relevant to other text objects in various complex 
ways. Our goal is to utilize the many machine learning tools 
available to create more sophisticated models of intertextual 
relation than the monolithic notion of “similarity.”
We plan to adapt various ideas from information retrieval and 
machine learning for our use. Measures of document similarity 
form the basis of modern information retrieval systems, which 
use a variety of techniques to compare input search strings to 
document instances. In 1995, Singhal and Salton[2] proposed 
that vector space similarity measures may also help to identify 
related documents without human intervention such as human-
embedded hypertext links. Work by James Allan[3] suggests 
the possibility of categorizing automatically generated links 
using innate characteristics of the text objects, for example by 
asserting the asymmetric relation “summary and expansion” 
based on the relative sizes of objects judged to be similar. 
Because we will operate not with a single similarity metric but 
with the results of multiple classifi ers and clusterers, we can 
expand on this technique, categorizing intertextual links by 
feeding all of our data into a fi nal voting mechanism such as a 
decision tree.
Our experiments with intertextual discovery began with using 
vector space calculations to try to identify that most direct of 
intertextual relationships, plagiarism or borrowing. Using the 
interactive vector space function in PhiloMine[4], we compared 
the 77,000 articles of the 18th century Encyclopédie of Diderot 
and d’Alembert to the 77,000 entries in a reference work 
contemporary to it, the Dictionnaire universel françois et latin, 
published by the Jesuits in the small town of Trévoux. The Jesuit 
defenders of the Dictionnaire de Trévoux, as it was popularly 
known, loudly accused the Encyclopédists of extensive 
plagiarism, a charge Diderot vigorously refuted, but which 
has never been systematically investigated by scholars. Our 
procedure is to compare all articles beginning with a specifi c 
letter in the Encyclopédie to all Trévoux articles beginning with 
the same letter. For each article in the Encyclopédie, the system 
displays each Trévoux article that scores above a user-designated 
similarity threshold. Human readers manually inspect possible 
matches, noting those that were probably plagiarized. Having 
completed 18 of 26 letters, we have found more than 2,000 
articles (over 5% of those consulted) in the Encyclopédie were 
“borrowed” from the Dictionnaire de Trévoux, a surprisingly 
large proportion given the well-known antagonism between 
the Jesuits and Encyclopédists.[5]

The Encyclopédie experiment has shown us strengths and 
weaknesses of the vector space model on one specifi c kind 
of textual relationship, borrowing, and has spurred us to 
devise an expanded approach to fi nd additional types of 
intertextual links. Vector space proves to be very effective 
at fi nding textual similarities indicative of borrowing, even in 
cases where signifi cant differences occur between passages. 
However, vector space matching is not as effective at fi nding 
articles borrowed from the Trévoux that became parts of 
larger Encyclopédie articles, suggesting that we might profi t 
from shrinking the size of our comparison objects, with 
paragraph-level objects being one obvious choice. In manually 
sifting through proposed borrowings, we also noticed articles 
that weren’t linked by direct borrowing, but in other ways 
such as shared topic, tangential topic, expansion on an idea, 
differing take on the same theme, etc. We believe that some 
of these qualities may be captured by other machine learning 
techniques. Experiments with document clustering using 
packages such as CLUTO have shown promise in identifying 
text objects of similar topic, and we have had success using 
naive Bayesian classifi ers to label texts by topic, authorial style 
and time period. Different feature sets also offer different 
insights, with part-of-speech tagging reducing features to a 
bare, structural minimum and N-gram features providing a 
more semantic perspective. Using clustering and classifi ers 
operating on a variety of featuresets should improve the 
quality of proposed intertextual links as well as a providing 
a way to assign different types of relationships, rather than 
simply labeling two text objects as broadly similar.
To test our hypothesis, we will conduct experiments linking 
Encyclopédie articles to running text in other contemporaneous 
French literature and reference materials using the various 
techniques we have described, with an emphasis on 
intelligently synthesizing the results of various machine learning 
techniques to validate and characterize proposed linkages. We 
will create vector representations of surface form, lemma, 
and ngram feature sets for the Encyclopédie and the object 
texts as a pre-processing step before subjecting the data 
to clustering and categorization of several varieties. Models 
trained on the Encyclopédie will be used to classify and cluster 
running text, so that for each segment of text we will have a 
number of classifi cations and scores that show how related 
it is to various Encyclopédie articles and classes of articles. A 
decision tree will be trained to take into account all of the 
classifi cations and relatedness measures we have available, 
along with innate characteristics of each text object such as 
length, and determine whether a link should exist between 
two give text objects, and if so what kind of link. We believe 
a decision tree model is a good choice because such models 
excel at generating transparent classifi cation procedures from 
low dimensionality data.
The toolbox that we have inherited or appropriated from 
information retrieval needs to be extended to address 
humanistic issues of intertextuality that are irreducible 
to single numerical scores or ranked lists of documents. 
Humanists know that texts, and parts of texts, participate in 
complex relationships of various kinds, far more nuanced than 
the reductionist concept of “similarity” that IR has generally 
adopted. Fortunately, we have a wide variety of machine 
learning tools at our disposal which can quantify different 
kinds of relatedness. By taking a broad view of all these 
measures, while looking narrowly at smaller segments of texts 
such as paragraphs, we endeavor to design a system that can 
propose specifi c kinds of lower-level intertextual relationships 
that more accurately refl ect the richness and complexity of 
humanities texts. This kind of tool is necessary to aid the 
scholar in bridging the gap between the distant view required 
to manipulate our massive modern text repositories, and the 
traditional close, contextual reading that forms the backbone 
of humanistic textual study.
