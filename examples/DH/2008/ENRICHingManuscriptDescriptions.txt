ENRICH is a pan-European eContent+ project led by the 
Czech National Library, starting 1 December 2007, which 
is creating a base for the European digital library of cultural 
heritage (manuscript, incunabula, early printed books, and 
archival papers) by the integration of existing but scattered 
electronic content within the Manuscriptorium digital library 
through the use of the metadata enrichment and coordination 
between heterogeneous metadata and data standards. The 
consortium brings together critical mass of content, because 
the project groups together the three richest owners of 
digitized manuscripts among national libraries in Europe 
(Czech Republic, Iceland and Serbia as associated partners); 
ENRICH partner libraries possess almost 85% currently 
digitized manuscripts in the national libraries in Europe, which 
will be enhanced by substantial amount of data from university 
libraries and other types of institutions in terms of several 
hundreds of thousands of digitized pages plus hundreds of 
thousands of pages digitized by the partners through the 
European Library data collections. When the project has 
fi nished the consortium will make available more than an 
estimated 5,076,000 digitized pages.
ENRICH <http://enrich.manuscriptorium.com/> builds 
upon the existing Manuscriptorium platform <http://www.
manuscriptorium.com/> and is adapting it to the needs of 
those organizations holding repositories of manuscripts. 
The principle of integration is centralisation of the metadata 
(descriptive evidence records) within the Manuscriptorium 
digital library and distribution of data (other connected 
digital documents) among other resources within the virtual 
net environment. That is, the metadata of the manuscript 
descriptions is aggregated in a single place and format to assist 
with searching these disparate repositories, but the images and 
original metadata records remain with the resource-holding 
institutions.
ENRICH target groups are content owners/holders, Libraries, 
museums and archives, researchers & students, policy makers 
and general interest users. The project allows them to search 
and access documents which would otherwise be hardly 
accessible by providing free access to almost all digitized 
manuscripts in Europe. Besides images it also offers access 
to TEI-structured historical full texts, research resources, 
other types of illustrative data (audio and video fi les) or large 
images of historical maps. The ENRICH consortium is closely 
cooperating with TEL (The European Library) and will become 
a component part of the European Digital Library when this 
becomes reality.

Manuscriptorium is currently searchable via OAI-PMH from 
the TEL portal, this means that any ENRICH full or associated 
partner automatically enriches the European Digital Library. 
The main quality of ENRICH and Manuscriptorium is the 
application of homogeneous and seamless access to widespread 
resources including access to images from the distributed 
environment under a single common interface. ENRICH 
supports several levels of communication with remote digital 
resources, ranging from OAI harvesting of partner libraries 
to full integration of their resources into Manuscriptorium. 
Furthermore, ENRICH has developed free tools to assist in 
producing XML structured digitized historical documents, and 
these are already available and ready to use. However, the 
existing XML schema refl ects the results of the now-dated 
EU MASTER project for TEI-based manuscript descriptions. It 
also incorporates other modern content standards, especially 
in the imaging area. It is this schema that is being updated to 
refl ect the developments in manuscript description available 
in TEI P5. The internal Manuscriptorium format is based on 
METS containerization of the schema and related parallel 
descriptions which enables a fl exible approach needed by the 
disparate practices of researchers in this fi eld.
The Research Technology Services section of the Oxford 
University Computing Services is leading the crucial work-
package on the standardization of shared metadata. In addition 
to a general introduction to the project it is the progress of 
this work-package which the proposed paper will discuss. This 
work-package is creating a formal TEI specifi cation, based on 
the TEI P5 Guidelines, for the schema to be used to describe

manuscripts managed within Manuscriptorium. The use of 
this specifi cation enables automatic generation of reference 
documentation in different languages and the creation of a 
formal DTD or Schemas as well as formal DTD or Schemas. A 
suite of tools is also being developed to convert automatically 
existing sets of manuscript descriptions, where this is feasible, 
and to provide simple methods of making them conformant 
to the new standard where it is not. These tools are being 
developed and validated against the large existing base of 
adopters of the Master standard and will be distributed free 
of charge by the TEI.
The proposed paper will report on the development and 
validation of a TEI conformant specifi cation for the existing 
Manuscriptorium schema using the TEI P5 specifi cation 
language (ODD). This involved a detailed examination of the 
current schema and documentation developed for the existing 
Manuscriptorium repository and its replacement by a formal 
TEI specifi cation. This specifi cation will continue to be further 
enhanced in light of the needs identifi ed by project participants 
and the wider MASTER community to form the basis of a new 
schema and documentation suite. The paper will report on the 
project’s production of translations for the documentation in 
at least English, French, Czech, German, as well as schemas to 
implement it both as DTD and RELAXNG. The production of 
these schemas and the translated documentation are produced 
automatically from the TEI ODD fi le.
A meeting of representatives from other European institutions 
who have previously used the MASTER schema has been 
organized where the differences in how they have used the 
schema will have been explored, along with their current 
practice for manuscript description. The aim is to validate both 
the coverage of the new specifi cation and the feasibility and 
ease of automatic conversion towards it. The outputs from this 
activity will include a report on any signifi cant divergence of 
practice amongst the sample data sets investigated. The ODD 
specifi cation will continue to be revised as necessary based 
on the knowledge gained from the consultation with other 
MASTER users. This will help to create an enriched version of 
the preliminary specifi cations produced. Finally, software tools 
are being developed to assist in conversion of sets of records 
produced for earlier MASTER specifi cations, and perhaps 
some others, to the new TEI P5 conformant schema. These 
tools are being tested against the collection of datasets gained 
from the participants of the meeting with other MASTER 
users, but also more widely within the TEI community. OUCS 
is also preparing tutorial material and discussion papers on 
the best practice to assist other institutions with migration 
existing MASTER material to the new standard. In this subtask 
ENRICH is cooperating with a broader TEI-managed effort 
towards the creation of TEI P5 migration documentation and 
resources.
An OAI-PMH harvester is being implemented and incorporated 
into Manuscriptorium. The fi rst step is to ensure that OAI/
PMH metadata is available for harvesting from all the resources 
managed within Manuscriptorium. Appropriate software tools 
to perform this harvesting are also being developed. Eventually, 
the internal environment of Manuscriptorium will be enhanced 
through implementation of METS containerization of the 
Manuscriptorium Scheme. This will involve an assessment 
of the respective roles of the TEI Header for manuscript 
description and of a METSconformant resource description 
and will enable different kinds of access to the resources 
within the Manuscriptorium. This will help to demonstrate for 
others the interoperability of these two important standards, 
and in particular where their facilities are complementary.
Improvement and generalization of Unicode treatment in 
Manuscriptorium is the fi nal part of the OUCS-led work 
package.  As Manuscriptorium is basically an XML system, all the 
data managed is necessarily represented in Unicode. This could 
cause problems for materials using non-standard character 
encodings, for example where manuscript descriptions 
quote from ancient scripts and include glyphs not yet part of 
Unicode. The TEI recommendations for the representation of 
nonstandard scripts are being used within ENRICH project 
which is producing a suite of non-standard character and glyph 
descriptions appropriate to the project’s needs.
The proposed paper is intended as a report on the work 
done in the conversion and rationalization of manuscript 
metadata across a large number of archives with disparate 
practices. While it will introduce the project to delegates 
at Digital Humanities 2008, it will concentrate on reporting 
the the problems and successes encountered in the course 
of these aspects of project. Although the overall project will 
not be fi nished by the time of the conference, the majority 
of the work in developing a suite of conversion tools will be 
complete by this time and the paper will focus on this work. 
As such, although it will detail work done by the author, it will 
rely on work by project partners who although not listed as 
authors here will be briefl y acknowledged in the paper where 
appropriate.
