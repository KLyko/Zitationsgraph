comparative analysis 
of adaptations based 
on vocabulary rich text 
segments: the assessment of 
Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code 
and its translations

In this work the appearance of the newly introduced words 
of The Da Vinci Code and its different translations have been 
analyzed and compared. The concept “newly introduced words” 
refers to the words whose fi rst appearance is detected at a 
certain point of the text. In general the number of the newly 
introduced words follows a monotonic decay, however, there 
are segments of the texts where this descending is reversed 
and a sudden increase is detectable (Csernoch, 20066a, 
2006b, 2007) – these text slices are referred to as vocabulary 
rich text slices. The question arises whether the detectable, 
unexpectedly high number of newly introduced words of the 
original work is traceable in the different translations of the 
text or not.
Before advancing on the project let us defi ne the concept of 
translation. In this context the defi nition of Hatim and Mason 
(1993) is accepted, that is any adaptation of a literary work 
is considered as translation. Beyond the foreign language 
translations of The Da Vinci Code two more adaptations, the 
lemmatized and the condensed versions of the original work 
were analyzed.
The comparison of the newly introduced word types and 
lemmas of the different translations allows us to trace how 
precisely translation(s) follow(s) the changes in the vocabulary 
of the original text. Whether the vocabulary rich sections of 
the original text appear similarly rich in the translations, or the 
translations swallow them up, or the translations are richer 
at certain sections than the original work. In addition, could 
the changes in the newly introduced words, as an additional 
parameter to those already applied, be used to give a hint of 
the quality of a translation?
To carry out the analysis a previously introduced method 
was applied (Csernoch, 2006a, 2006b). The text was divided 
into constant-length intervals, blocks. The number of the 
newly introduced words was mapped to each block. Those 
text segments were considered vocabulary rich, in which the 
number of the newly introduced words signifi cantly exceeds 
that predicted by a fi rst-order statistical model.
The original The Da Vinci Code
In the original The Da Vinci Code eleven signifi cant, vocabulary 
rich, text slices were detected. This number is similar to what 
was found in other, previously analyzed works (Csernoch, 
2007). However, a further analysis of these text slices was 
applied to reveal their nature. Four parameters,
– the distribution of these text slices within the text,
– their length – the number of blocks in the signifi cant text 
slice,
– their intensity – the local maximum of the relative number 
of the newly introduced words, and
– their content were determined.
The majority of the signifi cant text slices of The Da Vinci Code 
both in lengths and intensity turned out to be unusually small, 
containing descriptions of events, characters and places. None 
of them stands for stylistic changes which usually (Baayen, 
2001) trigger extremely vocabulary rich text slices. The 
distribution of them is uneven, they mainly appear in the fi rst 
half of the text. This means that the second half of the novel 
hardly introduces any more vocabulary items that predicted 
by a fi rst-order statistical model.
The analysis of the lemmatized texts
To see whether the word types, with all their suffi xes, are 
responsible for any losses of vocabulary rich text slices, the 
lemmatization, as an adaptation of the text, was carried out. 
As it was found earlier (Csernoch, 2006b), the lemmatization 
of the text produced minor, if any, differences in the analysis 
of the word types in an English text. To the English non-
lemmatized and lemmatized The Da Vinci Code their Hungarian 
correspondences were compared. Unlike the English texts, at 
the beginning of the Hungarian texts the number of newly 
introduced word types was so high that up to the fi rst two 
hundred blocks (20,000 tokens), some of the text slices with 
signifi cantly high number of newly introduced word types 
might be swallowed up.
The foreign language translations of 
The Da Vinci Code
While the absolute numbers of the newly introduced words of 
texts in different languages cannot, their relative numbers can 
be compared using the method outlined in Csernoch (2006a). 
Relying on the advantages of the method three different 
translations were compared to the original text, the Hungarian, 
the German, and the French. If the vocabulary rich text slices 
are found at the same positions both in the original and in 
the translated text, the translation can then be considered as 
exact in respect of vocabulary richness.

In the Hungarian translation the lengths and the intensities 
of the vocabulary rich text slices were not altered, however 
their distribution was more even than in the English text, and 
their number increased to sixteen. While the vocabulary rich 
text slices of the English text were all found in the Hungarian 
text, further such text slices were identifi ed in the second 
half of the Hungarian text. The comparison revealed that the 
Hungarian text is richer in vocabulary than the English text.
The German translation replicated the vocabulary rich text 
slices of the original English text, and provided fi ve more, 
which, similarly to the Hungarian translation, means that these 
text slices are richer in vocabulary than the corresponding 
text slices in the English text.
In the French translation only nine signifi cant text slices were 
found. All of these text slices were only one block long, and 
their intensities were also surprisingly small. This means that 
the distribution of the newly introduced words in the French 
translation hardly differs from that predicted by the model. 
Furthermore, they are quite different in content from the 
vocabulary rich text slices in the other languages. Thus, there 
are hardly any concentrated, vocabulary rich text slices in the 
French text.
The condensed versions of The Da Vinci 
Code
Finally, the condensed versions of the English and Hungarian 
texts were compared to the corresponding full-length text 
and to each other. Several questions are to be answered in 
this context. By the nature of this adaptation it is obvious that 
the length of the text is curtailed to some extent. However, 
this parameter does not tell much about the nature of the 
condensation. We do not know from this parameter whether 
the condensation is only a cropping of the original text – 
certain text segments are left out while others are untouched 
– or the whole text is modifi ed to some extent. If the text 
is modifi ed, the percentage of the remaining tokens, word 
types, lemmas, and hapax legomena are parameters which tell 
us more about the condensation. To get a further insight it is 
worth considering how the vocabulary rich text segments of 
the original text are transferred into the condensed text. This 
last parameter might be a great help in deciding from which 
fi rst order adaptation a second order adaptation of a text – in 
this case the condensed Hungarian text – is derived.
Both the English and the Hungarian condensed texts are 45% 
of the original texts in length. The number of word types is 
64 and 55%, the number of lemmas are 64 and 61%, while 
the number of hapax legomena is 70 and 56% of the English 
and Hungarian full-length texts, respectively. These parameters 
indicate that the Hungarian condensed text bore more serious 
damage than the English did. The number of vocabulary rich 
text segments dropped to six – somewhat more than the half 
of original number – in the English text. On the other hand, the 
number of these text segments in the Hungarian text dropped 
to one-third, which is a notable difference compared to the 
full-length Hungarian text. Both in the condensed English 
and Hungarian texts the vocabulary rich segments were 
concentrated to the fi rst half of the texts representing the 
same events, none of the segments unique to the full-length 
Hungarian text appeared in the condensed Hungarian text. The 
cumulative length of the vocabulary rich text slices dropped 
to 51% in the English and to 43% in the Hungarian text. Again, 
the Hungarian text seemed to be damaged to a greater extent. 
All the analyzed parameters thus clearly indicate that for the 
condensed Hungarian version the condensed English text was 
the direct source.
