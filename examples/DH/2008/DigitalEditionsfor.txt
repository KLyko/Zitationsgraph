Introduction
One relatively unexplored area in the expanding fi eld of digital 
humanities is the interface between textual and contextual 
studies, namely linguistics and history. Up to now, few digital 
editions of historical texts have been designed with linguistic 
study in mind. Equally few linguistic corpora have been 
designed with the needs of historians in mind. This paper 
introduces a new interdisciplinary project, Digital Editions for 
Corpus Linguistics (DECL). The aim of the project is to create 
a model for new, linguistically oriented online digital editions 
of historical manuscripts. 
Digital editions, while on a theoretical level clearly more 
useful to scholars than print editions, have not yet become 
the norm for publishing historical texts. To some extent this 
can be argued to result from the lack of a proper publishing 
infrastructure and user-friendly tools (Robinson 2005), which 
limit the possibilities of individual scholars and small-scale 
projects to produce digital editions.
The practical approach taken by the DECL project is to develop 
a detailed yet fl exible framework for producing electronic 
editions of historical manuscript texts. Initially, the development 
of this framework will be based on and take place concurrently 
with the work on three digital editions of Late Middle and Early 
Modern English manuscript material. Each of these editions—a 
Late Medieval bilingual medical handbook, a family of 15th-
century culinary recipe collections, and a collection of early 
17th-century intelligence letters—will serve both as a template 
for the encoding guidelines for that particular text type and 
as a development platform for the common toolset. Together, 
the toolset and the encoding guidelines are designed to enable 
editors of manuscript material to create digital editions of 
their material with reasonable ease.
Theoretical background
The theoretical basis of the project is dually grounded in the 
fi elds of manuscript studies and corpus linguistics. The aim 
of the project is to create a solid pipeline from the former 
to the latter: to facilitate the representation of manuscript 
reality in a form that is amenable to corpus linguistic study. 
Since context and different kinds of metatextual features are 
important sources of information for such fi elds as historical 
pragmatics, sociolinguistics and discourse analysis, the focus 
must be equally on document, text and context. By document we 
refer to the actual manuscript, by text to the linguistic contents 
of the document, and by context to both the historical and 
linguistic circumstances relating to text and the document. In 
practice this division of focus means that all of these levels are 
considered equally important facets of the manuscript reality 
and are thus to be represented in the edition. 
On the level of the text, DECL adopts the opinion of Lass 
(2004), that a digital edition should preserve the text as 
accurately and faithfully as possible, convey it in as fl exible a 
form as possible, and ensure that any editorial intervention 
remains visible and reversible. We also adopt a similar approach 
with respect to the document and its context: the editorial 
framework should enable and facilitate the accurate encoding 
and presentation of both the diplomatic and bibliographical 
features of the document, and the cultural, situational and 
textual contexts of both the document and the text. In keeping 
with the aforementioned aims, the development of both the 
editions, and the tools and guidelines for producing them, will 
be guided by the following three principles.
Flexibility
The editions seek to offer a fl exible user interface that will be 
easy to use and enable working with various levels of the texts, 
as well as selecting the features of the text, document and 
context that are to be included in the presentation or analysis 
of the text. All editions produced within the framework will 
build on similar logic and general principles, which will be 
fl exible enough to accommodate the specifi c needs of any 
text type.
Transparency
The user interfaces of the editions will include all the features 
that have become expected in digital editions. But in addition 
to the edited text and facsimile images of the manuscripts, 
the user will also be able to access the raw transcripts and 
all layers of annotation. This makes all editorial intervention 
transparent and reversible, and enables the user to evaluate 
any editorial decisions. 
Expandability
The editions will be built with future expansion and updating in 
mind. This expandability will be three-dimensional in the sense 
that new editions can be added and linked to existing ones, 
and both new documents and new layers of annotation or

information can be added to existing editions. Furthermore, the 
editions will not be hardwired to a particular software solution, 
and their texts can be freely downloaded and processed for 
analysis with external software tools. The editions will be 
maintained on a web server and will be compatible with all 
standards-compliant web browsers. 
Technical methods
Following the aforementioned principles, the electronic 
editions produced by the project will reproduce the features 
of the manuscript text as a faithful diplomatic transcription, 
into which linguistic, palaeographic and codicological features 
will be encoded, together with associated explanatory notes 
elucidating the contents and various contextual aspects of the 
text. The encoding standard used for the editions will be based 
on and compliant with the latest incarnation of the TEI XML 
standard (P5, published 1.11.2007), with any text-type specifi c 
features incorporated as additional modules to the TEI schema. 
The XML-based encoding will enable the editions to be used 
with any XML-aware tools and easily converted to other 
document or database standards. In addition to the annotation 
describing the properties of the document, text and context, 
further layers of annotation—e.g. linguistic analysis—can be 
added to the text later on utilising the provisions made in the 
TEI P5 standard for standoff XML markup.
The editorial strategies and annotation practices of the three 
initial editions will be carefully coordinated and documented 
to produce detailed guidelines, enabling the production of 
further compatible electronic editions. The tools developed 
concurrently with and tested on the editions themselves 
will make use of existing open source models and software 
projects—such as GATE or Heart of Gold, teiPublisher and 
Xaira—to make up a sophisticated yet customisable annotation 
and delivery system. The TEI-based encoding standard will also 
be compatible with the ISO/TC 37/SC 4 standard, facilitating 
the linguistic annotation of the text. 
Expected results
One premise of this project is that creating digital editions 
based on diplomatic principles will help raise the usefulness 
of digitised historical texts by broadening their scope and 
therefore also interest in them. Faithful reproduction of the 
source text is a requisite for historical corpus linguistics, 
but editions based on diplomatic transcripts of manuscript 
sources are equally amenable to historical or literary enquiry. 
Combining the approaches of different disciplines—historical 
linguistics, corpus linguistics, history—to creating electronic 
text databases should lead to better tools for all disciplines 
involved and increase interdisciplinary communication and 
cooperation. If they prove to be successful, the tools and 
guidelines developed by DECL will also be readily applicable 
to the editing and publication of other types of material, 
providing a model for integrating the requirements and desires 
of different disciplines into a single solution. 
The fi rst DECL editions are being compiled at the Research 
Unit for Variation, Contacts and Change in English (VARIENG) 
at the University of Helsinki, and will form the bases for three 
doctoral dissertations. These editions, along with a working 
toolset and guidelines, are scheduled to be available within the 
next fi ve years. 
Since the aim of the DECL project is to produce an open 
access model for multipurpose and multidisciplinary digital 
editions, both the editions created by the DECL project 
and the tools and guidelines used in their production will 
be published online under an open access license. While the 
project strongly advocates open access publication of scholarly 
work, it also acknowledges that this may not be possible due 
to ongoing issues with copyright, for example in the case of 
facsimile images.
The DECL project is also intended to be open in the sense that 
participation or collaboration by scholars or projects working 
on historical manuscript materials is gladly welcomed.

 The Moonstone and The Co-
quette: Narrative and Episto-
lary Styles 
 David L. Hoover 
david.hoover@nyu.edu
 New York University, USA 
In his seminal work on Austen, John F. Burrows demonstrates 
that characters can be distinguished from each another on 
the basis of the frequencies of the most frequent words of 
their dialogue treating the characters as if they were authors 
(1987). Computational stylistics has also been used to study 
the distinctive interior monologues of Joyce’s characters in 
Ulysses (McKenna and Antonia 1996), the styles of Charles 
Brockden Brown’s narrators (Stewart 2003), style variation 
within a novel (Hoover 2003), and the interaction of character 
separation and translation (Rybicki 2006). Here I address two 
kinds of local style variation: the multiple narrators of Wilkie 
Collins’s The Moonstone (1868) and the multiple letter writers 
in Hannah Webster Foster’s sentimental American epistolary 
novel The Coquette (1797).
The Moonstone has several narrators whose styles seem 
intuitively distinct, though all the narrations share plot elements, 
characters, and physical and cultural settings. The Coquette, 
based on an infamous true story, and very popular when it 
was published,  is read today more for its cultural signifi cance 
and its proto-feminist tendencies than for its literary merit. 
Nevertheless, one would expect the  coquette, the evil 
seducer, the virtuous friend, and the disappointed suitor to 
write distinctively. Treating the narrators and letter writers of 
these two novels as different authors will test how successfully 
Collins and Foster distinguish their voices and shed light on 
some practical and theoretical issues of authorship and style.
Computational stylistics cannot be applied to narrators 
and letter writers of these novels, however, unless they can 
distinguish Collins and Foster from their contemporaries. 
Experiments on a 10-million word corpus of forty-six Victorian 
novels confi rm that Collins is easily distinguished from fi ve 
of his contemporaries, as shown in Fig. I. For The Coquette, I 
have made the task more diffi cult by comparing Foster’s letter 
writers to those of fi ve other late 18th-century epistolary 
novels by fi ve authors. I separated all the letters by writer and 
addressee and retaining  only the 22 writers with the most 
letters, then combined the letters between each single writer 
and addressee and cut the combined texts into 42 sections 
of about 3,500 words. Both Delta and cluster analysis do a 
good job on this diffi cult task, and many Delta analyses give 
completely correct results. Cluster analysis is slightly less 
accurate, but several analyses are correct for fi ve of the six 
authors; they also show that individual letter writers strongly 
tend to group together within the cluster for each novel (see 
Fig. 2).
Examining the individual novels reveals a sharp contrast: 
Collins’s narrators are internally consistent and easy to 
distinguish, while Foster’s letter writers are much less internally 
consistent and much more diffi cult to distinguish. For Collins, 
cluster analysis consistently groups all narrative sections of 
6 of the 7 narrators. When a modifi ed technique developed 
especially for investigating intra-textual style variation is used 
(Hoover 2003), the results are even better. As Fig. 3 shows, 
all sections by all narrators sometimes cluster correctly (the 
sections range from 4,300 to 6,900 words).
“Tuning” the analysis to produce better clustering may seem 
circular in an analysis that tests whether Collins’s narrators 
have consistent idiolects. But this objection can be answered by 
noting the consistency of the groupings. The stable clustering 
across large ranges of analyses with different numbers of 
MFW that is found here is obviously more signifi cant than 
frequently-changing clustering.
Note also that the sections strongly tend to occur in narrative 
order in Fig. 3: every two-section cluster consists of contiguous 
sections. This “echo” of narrative structure provides further 
evidence that the analysis is accurately characterizing the 
narrators’ styles.

A fi ne-grained investigation of The Moonstone involving smaller 
sections and including more narrators puts Collins’s ability to 
differentiate his narrators to a sterner test, but some cluster 
analyses are again completely correct. The distinctiveness of the 
narrators of The Moonstone is thus confi rmed by computational 
stylistics: the narrators behave very much as if they were 
literally different authors. Given the length of the novel, the 
generic constraints of narrative, and the inherent similarities 
of plot and setting, this is a remarkable achievement.
For my analysis of The Coquette, I have added 3 more sections 
of letters, so that there are 13 sections of approximately 3,000 
words by 6 writers, with separate sections by a single writer 
to two different addressees. Although these sections should 
be considerably easier to group than those in the fi ne-grained 
analysis of The Moonstone, the results are not encouraging. 
Cluster analyses based on the 300-700 MFW produce very 
similar but not very accurate results, in all of which letters by 
Boyer and Eliza appear in both main clusters (see Fig. 4). Lucy’s 
letters to Eliza also cluster with the last section of Eliza’s letters 
to Lucy in all of these analyses a misidentifi cation as strong as 
any correct one. In a real authorship attribution problem, such 
results would not support the conclusion that all of Boyer’s 
or Eliza’s letters were written by a single author. Perhaps one 
could argue that Boyer’s letters to Selby should be different 
from his letters to Eliza, and perhaps it is appropriate that 
Eliza’s last section includes only despairing letters written 
after Boyer has rejected her. Yet such special pleading is almost 
always possible after the fact. Further, any suggestion that 
Boyer’s letters to Eliza should be distinct from those to Selby 
is impossible to reconcile with the fact that they cluster so 
consistently with Eliza’s early letters to Lucy. And if Eliza’s early 
and late letters should be distinct, it is diffi cult understand the 
clustering of the early letters with those of Boyer to Selby and 
the consistent clustering of the late letters with Lucy’s letters 
to Eliza. It is diffi cult to avoid the conclusion that Foster has 
simply failed to create distinct and consistent characters in 
The Coquette.
In contrast, Fanny Burney, whose Evelina is included in the 
novels compared with The Coquette, above, creates very 
distinct voices for the letter writers. Although only four of 
the writers have parts large enough for reasonable analysis, 
Evelina writes to both her adoptive father Mr. Villars and her 
friend Miss Mirvan, and Villars writes both to Evelina and 
to Lady Howard. One might expect signifi cant differences 
between letters to these very different addressees. Evelina’s 
style might also be expected to change over the course of this 
bildungsroman. However, analyses of all 34 sections of letters 
from Evelina (approximately 2,500 words long), show that 
Burney’s characters are much more distinct and consistent 
than Foster’s, as a representative analysis shows (see Fig. 5). 
This dendogram also strongly refl ects the narrative structure 
of the novel. Burney, like Collins, is very successful in creating 
distinctive voices for her characters.
Criticism of Foster’s novel has paid little attention to the 
different voices of the characters, but what commentary there 
is does not suggest that the patterns shown above should 
have been predictable. Smith-Rosenberg, for example, suggests 
a contrast between Eliza and “the feminized Greek chorus of 
Richman, Freeman, and Eliza’s widowed mother, who, at the 
end, can only mouth hollow platitudes” (2003: 35). Although 
these women and Julia are often considered a monolithic 
group urging conventional morality, the distinctness of Julia’s

136
sections, especially from Lucy’s (see Fig. 5) might suggest 
a reexamination of this notion, and might reveal how the 
styles of Julia and the other women are related to more 
signifi cant differences of opinion, character, or principle. 
Various suggestions about changes in Eliza over the course of 
the novel might also benefi t from a closer investigation of the 
language of the letters. Because Foster’s novel is of interest 
chiefl y on cultural, historical, and political grounds rather than 
literary ones, however, such an investigation is more likely to 
advance the theory and practice of computational stylistics 
than the criticism of The Coquette. It is clear, at any rate, that 
computational stylistics is adequate to the task of distinguishing 
narrators and letter writers, so long as the author is adequate 
to the same task.
