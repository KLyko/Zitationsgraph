Introduction
In analyzing literary style through statistical methods, we 
often show our results by plotting graphs of various types, e.g. 
scatterplots, histograms, and dendrograms. While these help 
us to understand our results, they always necessarily “fl atten” 
the data into a 2- dimensional format. For the purposes of 
visualization of complex data, we might be better off trying to 
look at it three dimensionally if a suitable vector representation 
of the data is found fi rst. This paper investigates stance in three 
groups of popular fi ction, namely romance fi ction, detective 
fi ction written by female authors and detective fi ction written 
by male authors, and presents the results using both 2 
dimensional and three dimensional visualization.
Romance fi ction and detective novels are both characterized 
by the fact that they all have the same basic story. In romance 
fi ction it is the story of how the hero and heroine meet, 
how their relationship develops and how the happy ending 
is achieved. In detective fi ction it is the story of the murder, 
the unraveling of the case, the misleading clues and the fi nal 
solution. The same story is being retold over and over again, 
just as in the oral storytelling tradition (Radway 1984:198). The 
reader is not left in suspense of the fi nal outcome and each 
story is different from the others in the details of the events 
and the way the story is told. Through this the reader becomes 
involved in the story and partakes in the emotions, attitudes 
and thoughts of the protagonist. These feelings, emotions and 
moods are marked by syntactic and semantic features often 
referred to as markers of stance.
Stance refers to the expression of attitude and consists of 
two different types of expressions of attitude: evidentiality 
and affect (Biber and Finegan 1989). Evidentiality means that 
the reader becomes privy to the speaker’s attitudes towards 
whatever knowledge the speaker has, the reliability of that 
knowledge and how the speaker came about that knowledge. 
Affect refers to the personal attitudes of the speaker, i.e. his/
her emotions, feelings, moods, etc. Biber and Finegan (1989) 
investigated 12 different categories of features deemed to 
mark stance: certainty/doubt adverbs, certainty/doubt verbs, 
certainty/doubt adjectives, affective expressions, hedges, 
emphatics and necessity/possibility/predictive modals. They 
showed that different text types are likely to express stance 
in different ways. Opas and Tweedie (1999) studied stance 
in romance fi ction and showed that three types of romance 
fi ction can be separated by their expression of stance. This 
paper continues these studies, paying special attention to the 
visualization of the results.
Materials and methods
Our total corpus is 760 000 words. It consists of three parts: 
romance fi ction, female-authored detective fi ction and male-
authored detective fi ction, all published in the 1990s. The 
romance fi ction comprises a total of 240 000 words from the 
Harlequin Presents series, the Regency Romance series and 
Danielle Steel’s works, which are often classifi ed as women’s 
fi ction or ’cross-overs’. The female-authored detective fi ction 
part of our corpus includes Patricia Cornwell, Sue Grafton, 
P.D. James, Donna Leon, Ellis Peters, and Ruth Rendell. These 
texts make up 295 000 words. The rest of the corpus (229 000 
words) is made up of male-authored detective fi ction texts, 
including Colin Dexter, Michael Dibdin, Quintin Jardine, Ian 
Rankin and Peter Tremayne.
Principal components analysis was used to reduce the 12 
markers of stance to three dimensions which describe 52.4% 
of the variation in the data.
Results
In a previous study Opas and Tweedie (2000) concluded 
that the detective stories seem to mark evidentiality, i.e. the 
characters express their certainty and doubt. The romance 
stories, on the other hand, seem to mainly mark affect, i.e. 
the characters express their emotions and moods. In Biber 
and Finegan’s terms (1989), the detective fi ction texts show 
‘interactional evidentiality’ and the romance fi ction texts show 
‘emphatic expression of affect’.
The results in Figures 1 and 2 below show the female-authored 
detective stories in shades of red and yellow, the male-authored 
detective stories in shades of blue and the romance stories in 
shades of black. While in Figure 1 the female-authored texts 
are perhaps slightly more clearly separatable from the others, 
it still seems that all these texts are far more overlapping and 
less clearly distinguishable as three groups than the texts in 
previous studies were. However, broadly speaking, the romance 
texts are in the lower half of the graph, the female-authored 
detective texts in the upper half and the male-authored 
detective texts in the middle. What is surprising though is that 
no features seem to “pulling” texts downwards, towards the 
lower half of the graph; and that the feature that “pull” the 
texts upwards include both markers of certainty/doubt and 
affect.

Figure 1. PC1 and PC2 for detective and romance fi ction
Figure 2. PC2 and PC3 for detective and romance fi ction
Figure 2 seems to show similar results. Here, perhaps, the 
female-authored detective texts are even slightly more easily 
separated from the others, but the general impression of 
the male-authored texts and the romance texts overlapping 
remains. Yet again it seems that there are hardly any features 
accounting for the texts on the left-hand side of the graph and 
that the feature “pulling” the texts to the right include both 
features marking evidentiality and those marking affect.
These results are quite surprising. Either male-authored 
detective stories mark evidentiality and affect in the same 
manner as romance fi ction, and here is seems that they don’t 
show many features that would mark stance, or there is 
something more complex at work here. To help us understand 
these phenomena better, we would suggest visualizing the 
workings of the markers of stance in a 3 dimensional model. 
To this end, we have built a tool that takes the principal 
components analysis data, reduces dimensionality down to 
three components with the most energy and presents the data 
with these components. The software tool is implemented 
in the MATLAB® environment (The MathWorks, Inc., 
Massachusetts, USA) utilizing its 3D graphical functions. The 
tool is an interactive one, allowing the researcher to turn the 
3D model and look for the angles that best show the clustering 
structure and the differences between the texts. We will 
demonstrate how tools such as this one signifi cantly improve 
the researcher’s ability to visualize the research results and to 
interpret them.
