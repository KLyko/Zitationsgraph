 Orlando: Women’s Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings 
to the Present is a literary-historical textbase comprising more 
than 1,200 core entries on the lives and writing careers of 
British women writers, male writers, and international women 
writers; 13,000+ free-standing chronology entries providing 
context; 12,000+ bibliographical listings; and more than 2 
million tags embedded in 6.5 million words of born-digital 
text. The XML tagset allows users to interrogate everything 
from writers’ relationships with publishers to involvement in 
political activities or their narrative techniques.
The current interface allows users to access entries by name 
or via various criteria associated with authors; to create 
chronologies by searching on tags and/or contents of dated 
materials; and to search the textbase for tags, attributes, and 
text, or a combination. The XML serves primarily to structure 
the materials; to allow users to draw on particular tags to 
bring together results sets (of one or more paragraphs 
incorporating the actual ‘hit’) according to particular interests; 
and to provide automatic hyperlinking of names, places, 
organizations, and titles.
Recognizing both that many in our target user community of 
literary students and scholars dislike tag searches, and that 
our current interface has not fully plumbed the potential of 
Orlando’s experimentation in structured text, we are exploring 
what other kinds of enquiry and interfaces the textbase can 
support. We report here on some investigations into new ways 
of probing and representing the links created by the markup.
The current interface leverages the markup to provide 
contexts for hyperlinks. Each author entry includes a “Links” 
screen that provides hyperlinks to mentions of that author 
elsewhere in the textbase. These links are sorted into groups 
based on the semantic tags of which they are children, so that 
users can choose, for instance, from the more than 300 links 
on the George Eliot Links screen, between a link to Eliot in 
the Elizabeth Stuart Phelps entry that occurs in the context of 
Family or Intimate Relationships, and a link to Eliot in Simone 
de Beauvoir’s entry that occurs in the discussion of features 
of de Beauvoir’s writing. Contextualizing Links screens are 
provided not only for writers who have entries, but also for 
any person who is mentioned more than once in the textbase, 
and also for titles of texts, organizations, and places. It thus 
provides a unique means for users to pursue links in a less 
directed and more informed way than that provided by many 
interfaces.
Building on this work, we have been investigating how Orlando 
might support queries into relationships and networking, 
and present not just a single relationship but the results of 
investigating an entire fi eld of interwoven relationships of 
the kind that strongly interest literary historians. Rather than 
beginning from a known set of networks or interconnections, 
how might we exploit our markup to analyze interconnections, 
reveal new links, or determine the points of densest 
interrelationship? Interface design in particular, if we start to 
think about visualizing relationships rather than delivering 
them entirely in textual form, poses considerable challenges.
We started with the question of the degrees of separation 
between different people mentioned in disparate contexts 
within the textbase. Our hyperlinking tags allow us to 
conceptualize links between people not only in terms of direct 
contact, that is person-to-person linkages, but also in terms of 
linkages through other people, places, organizations, or texts 
that they have in common. Drawing on graph theory, we use 
the hyperlinking tags as key indices of linkages. Two hyperlinks 
coinciding within a single document—an entry or a chronology 
event--were treated as vertices that form an edge, and an 
algorithm was used to fi nd the shortest path between source 
and destination. So, for instance, you can get from Chaucer to 
Virginia Woolf in a single step in twelve different ways: eleven 
other writer entries (including Woolf’s own) bring their names 
together, as does the following event:
1 November 1907: The British Museum’s reading room 
reopened after being cleaned and redecorated; the dome 
was embellished with the names of canonical male writers, 
beginning with Chaucer and ending with Browning.
Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own describes the 
experience of standing under the dome “as if one were a 
thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly 
encircled by a band of famous names.” Julia Hege in Jacob’s 
Room complains that they did not leave room for an Eliot 
or a Brontë.
It takes more steps to get from some writers to others: fi ve, 
for instance, to get from Frances Harper to Ella Baker. But this 
is very much the exception rather than the rule.

Calculated according to the method described here, we have 
a vast number of links: the textbase contains 74,204 vertices 
with an average of 102 edges each (some, such as London at 
101,936, have considerably more than others), meaning that 
there are 7.5 million links in a corpus of 6.5 million words. 
Working just with authors who have entries, we calculated 
the number of steps between them all, excluding some of the 
commonest links: the Bible, Shakespeare, England, and London. 
Nevertheless, the vast majority of authors (on average 88%) 
were linked by a single step (such as the example of Chaucer 
and Woolf, in which the link occurs within the same source 
document) or two steps (in which there is one intermediate 
document between the source and destination names). 
Moreover, there is a striking similarity in the distribution of the 
number of steps required to get from one person to another, 
regardless of whether one moves via personal names, places, 
organizations, or titles. 10.6% of entries are directly linked, that 
is the two authors are mentioned in the same source entry or 
event. Depending on the hyperlinking tag used, one can get to 
the destination author with just one intermediate step, or two 
degrees of separation, in 72.2% to 79.6% of cases. Instances of 
greater numbers of steps decline sharply, so that there are 5 
degrees of separation in only 0.6% of name linkage pages, and 
none at all for places. Six degrees of separation does not exist 
in Orlando between authors with entries, although there are a 
few “islands”, in the order of from 1.6% to 3.2%, depending on 
the link involved, of authors who do not link to others.
These results raise a number of questions. As Albert-Lászlo 
Barabási reported of social networks generally, one isn’t dealing 
with degrees of separation so much as degrees of proximity. 
However, in this case, dealing not with actual social relations 
but the partial representation in Orlando of a network of social 
relations from the past, what do particular patterns such as 
these mean? What do the outliers—people such as Ella Baker 
or Frances Harper who are not densely interlinked with 
others—and islands signify? They are at least partly related 
to the brevity of some entries, which can result either from 
paucity of information, or decisions about depth of treatment, 
or both. But might they sometimes also represent distance 
from literary and social establishments? Furthermore, some 
linkages are more meaningful, in a literary historical sense, 
than others. For instance, the Oxford Dictionary of National 
Biography is a common link because it is frequently cited by 
title, not because it indicates a historical link between people. 
Such incidental links can’t be weeded out automatically. So we 
are investigating the possibility of using the relative number 
of single- or double-step links between two authors to 
determine how linked they ‘really’ are. For instance, Elizabeth 
Gaskell is connected to William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles 
Dickens, and George Eliot by 25, 35, and 53 single-step links, 
respectively, but to Margaret Atwood, Gertrude Stein, and 
Toni Morrison by 2, 1, and 1. Such contrasts suggest the likely 
utility of such an approach to distinguishing meaningful from 
incidental associations.
The biggest question invited by these inquiries into linkages 
is: how might new modes of inquiry into, or representation 
of, literary history, emerge from such investigations? One 
way to address this question is through interfaces. We have 
developed a prototype web application for querying degrees of 
separation in Orlando, for which we are developing an interface. 
Relationships or associations are conventionally represented 
by a network diagram, where the entities are shown as nodes 
and the relationships as lines connecting the nodes. Depending 
on the content, these kinds of fi gures are also referred to as 
directed graphs, link-node diagrams, entity-relationship (ER) 
diagrams, and topic maps. Such diagrams scale poorly, since 
the proliferation of items results in a tangle of intersecting 
lines. Many layout algorithms position the nodes to reduce the 
number of crisscrossing lines, resulting in images misleading to 
people who assume that location is meaningful.
In the case of Orlando, two additional complexities must be 
addressed. First, many inter-linkages are dense: there are often 
50 distinct routes between two people. A conventional ER 
diagram of this data would be too complex to be useful as 
an interactive tool, unless we can allow the user to simplify 
the diagram. Second, the Orlando data differs from the kind 
of data that would support “distant reading” (Moretti 1), so 
our readers will need to access the text that the diagram 
references. How, then, connect the diagram to a reading view? 
We will present our preliminary responses to these challenges 
in an interface for degree of separation queries and results. We 
are also experimenting with the Mandala browser (Cheypesh 
et al. 2006) for XML structures as a means of exploring 
embedded relationships. The current Mandala prototype 
cannot accommodate the amount of data and number of tags 
in Orlando, so we will present the results of experimenting 
with a subset of the hyperlinking tags as another means of 
visualizing the dense network of associations in Orlando’s 
representations of literary history.
