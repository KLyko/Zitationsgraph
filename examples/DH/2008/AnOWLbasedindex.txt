Intro
This paper describes an index on metaphor in Otto Vaenius’ 
emblem book Amoris divini emblemata (Antwerp, 1615). The 
index should be interesting both for its contents (that is, for 
the information about the use of metaphor in the book) and 
as an example of modelling a complex literary phenomenon. 
Modelling a complex phenomenon creates the possibility to 
formulate complex queries on the descriptions that are based 
on the model. The article describes an application that uses this 
possibility. The application user can interrogate the metaphor 
data in multiple ways, ranging from canned queries to complex 
selections built in the application’s guided query interface.
Unlike other emblem indices, the metaphor index is not meant 
to be a tool for resource discovery, a tool that helps emblem 
scholars fi nd emblems relevant to their own research. It presents 
research output rather than input. The modelling techniques 
that it exemplifi es should help a researcher formulate detailed 
observations or fi ndings about his research subject – in this 
case, metaphor – and make these fi ndings amenable to further 
processing. The result is an index, embedded in an overview 
or explanation of the data for the reader. I will argue that for 
research output data it is up to the researcher who uses these 
modelling techniques to integrate the presentation of data in 
a narrative or argument, and I describe one possible way of 
effecting this integration.
The paper builds on the techniques developed in (Boot 2006). 
The emblem book is encoded using TEI; a model of metaphor 
(an ontology) is formulated in OWL; the observations about 
the occurrence of metaphors are stored as RDF statements. 
An essay about the more important metaphors in this book 
is encoded in TEI. This creates a complex and interlinked 
structure that may be explored in a number of ways. The essay 
is hyperlinked to (1) individual emblems, (2) the presentation of 
individual metaphors in emblems, (3) searches in the metaphor 
data, and (4) concepts in the metaphor ontology. From each of 
these locations, further exploration is possible. Besides these 
ready-made queries, the application also facilitates user-defi ned 
queries on the metaphor data. The queries are formulated 
using the SPARQL RDF query language, but the application’s 
guided query interface hides the actual syntax from the user.
Metaphor model
There is a number of aspects of metaphor and the texts where 
metaphors occur that are modelled in the metaphor index. 
A metaphor has a vehicle and a tenor, in the terminology of 
Richards (1936). When love, for its strength en endurance 
in adversity, is compared to a tree, the tree is the vehicle, 
love is the tenor. It is possible to defi ne hierarchies, both 
for the comparands (that is, vehicles and tenors) and for the 
metaphors: we can state that ‘love as a tree’ (love being fi rmly 
rooted) belongs to a wider class of ‘love as a plant’ (love 
bearing fruit) metaphors. We can also state that a tree is a 
plant, and that it (with roots, fruit, leaves and seeds) belongs 
to the vegetal kingdom (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). It often 
happens that an emblem contains references to an object 
invested with metaphorical meaning elsewhere in the book. 
The index can record these references without necessarily 
indicating something they are supposed to stand for.
The index can also represent the locations in the emblem (the 
text and image fragments) that refer to the vehicles and tenors. 
The text fragments are stretches of emblem text, the image 
fragments are rectangular regions in the emblem pictures. The 
index uses the TEI-encoded text structure in order to relate 
occurrences of the comparands to locations in the text.
The metaphor model is formulated using the Web Ontology 
Language OWL (McGuinness and Van Harmelen 2004). An 
ontology models the kind of objects that exist in a domain, 
their relationships and their properties; it provides a shared 
understanding of a domain. On a technical level, the ontology 
defi nes the vocabulary to be used in the RDF statements in 
our model. The ontology thus limits the things one can say; 
it provides, in McCarty’s words (McCarty 2005), the ‘explicit, 
delimited conception of the world’ that makes meaningful 
manipulation possible. The ontology is also what ‘drives’ the 
application built for consultation of the metaphor index. See 
for similar uses of OWL: (Ciula and Vieira 2007), (Zöllner-
Weber 2005).
The paper describes the classes and the relationships between 
them that the OWL model contains. Some of these relationships 
are hierarchical (‘trees belong to the vegetal kingdom’), others 
represent relations between objects (‘emblem 6 uses the 
metaphor of life as a journey’ or ‘metaphor 123 is a metaphor 
for justice’). The relationships are what makes it possible to 
query objects by their relations to other objects: to ask for all 
the metaphors based in an emblem picture, to ask for all of the 
metaphors for love, or to combine these criteria.
Application
In order to present the metaphor index to a reader, a web 
application has been developed that allows readers to consult 
and explore the index. The application is an example of an 
ontology-driven application as discussed in (Guarino 1998): 
the data model, the application logic and the user interface are 
all based on the metaphor ontology.
The application was created using PHP and a MySQL database 
backend. RAP, the RDF API for PHP, is used for handling RDF.

are stored in an RDF model in the database. RDF triples that 
represent the structure of the emblem book are created from 
the TEI XML fi le that contains the digital text of the emblem 
book.
The application has to provide insight into three basic layers of 
information: our primary text (the emblems), the database-like 
collection of metaphor data, and a secondary text that should 
make these three layers into a coherent whole. The application 
organizes this in three perspectives: an overview perspective, 
an emblem perspective and an ontology perspective. Each of 
these perspectives offers one or more views on the data. These 
views are (1) a basic selection interface into the metaphor 
index; (2) an essay about the use and meaning of metaphor in 
this book; (3) a single emblem display; (4) information about 
metaphor use in the emblem; and (5) a display of the ontology 
defi ned for the metaphor index (built using the OWLDoc). 
The paper will discuss the ways in which the user can explore 
the metaphor data.
Discussion
The metaphor index is experimental, among other things in 
its modelling of metaphor and in its use of OWL and RDF 
in a humanities context. If Willard McCarty is right in some 
respects all humanities computing is experimental. There is, 
however, a certain tension between the experimental nature 
of this index and the need to collect a body of material and 
create a display application. If the aim is not to support resource 
discovery, but solely to provide insight, do we then need this 
large amount of data? Is all software meant to be discarded, as 
McCarty quotes Perlis? The need to introduce another aspect 
of metaphor into the model may confl ict with the need to 
create a body of material that it is worthwhile to explore. It 
is also true, however, that insight doesn’t come from subtlety 
alone. There is no insight without numbers.
McCarty writes about the computer as ‘a rigorously disciplined 
means of implementing trial-and-error (…) to help the scholar 
refi ne an inevitable mismatch between a representation and 
reality (as he or she conceives it) to the point at which the 
epistemological yield of the representation has been realized’. 
It is true that the computer helps us be rigorous and disciplined, 
but perhaps for that very reason the representations that the 
computer helps us build may become a burden. Computing can 
slow us down. To clarify the conceptual structure of metaphor 
as it is used in the book we do not necessarily need a work 
of reference. The paper’s concluding paragraphs will address 
this tension.
