Computer assisted reading and analysis of text (CARAT) 
has recently explored many variants of what has become 
fashionable to call “text mining” strategies. Text mining 
strategies are theoretically robust on large corpus. However, 
since they mainly operate at a macro textual level, their use is 
still the object of resistance by the expert readers that aim at 
fi ne and minute conceptual analysis. In this paper, we present 
a computer assisted strategy for assisting conceptual analysis 
based on automatic classifi cation and annotation strategies. 
We also report on experiment using this strategy on a small 
philosophical corpus.
Conceptual analysis is an expert interpretation methodology 
for the systematic exploration of semantic and inferential 
properties of set of predicates expressing a particular concept 
in a text or in a discourse (Desclés, 1997; Fodor, 1998; 
Brandom, 1994; Gardenfors, 2000; Rastier, 2005). Computer 
assisted reading and analysis of text (CARAT) is the computer 
assistance of this conceptual analysis.
The strategy of CACAT
Our text analysis strategy rests on the 
following main hypothesis:
The expression of a canonical concept in a text presents 
linguistics regularities some of which can be identifi ed using 
classifi cation algorithms
This hypothesis itself unwraps into three sub hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: conceptual analysis can be realized by the 
contextual exploration of the canonical forms of a concept
This is realized through the classical concordance 
strategy and variances on a pivotal term and its linguistic 
variants (e.g. mind, mental, mentally, etc.) (Pincemin 
et al., 2006; McCarthy, 2004; Rockwell, 2003).

Hypothesis 2: the exploration of the contexts of a concept is itself 
realized through some mathematical classifi cation strategy.
This second hypothesis postulates that contexts of 
a concept present regularities that can be identifi ed 
by mathematical clustering techniques that rest 
upon similarities found among contextual segments 
(Jain et al. 1999; Manning and Schütze, 1999).
Hypothesis 3: Classes of conceptual of similar conceptual 
contexts can be annotated so as to categorize their semantic 
content.
This last hypothesis allows to associate to each segment of a 
class of contexts some formal description of their content be it 
semantic, logical, pragmatic, rhetorical, etc. (Rastier et al., 2005; 
Djioua and Desclés, 2007; Meyers, 2005; Palmer et al., 2005; 
Teich et al., 2006). Some of these annotations can be realized 
through algorithms; others can only be done manually.
Experiment
From these three hypotheses emerges an experiment which 
unwraps in fi ve phases. This experiment was accomplished 
using C.S. Peirce’s Collected Papers (volumes I-VIII) (Peirce, 
1931, 1935, 1958). More specifi cally, this research aimed 
at assisting conceptual analysis of the concept of “Mind” in 
Peirce’s writings.
Phase 1: Text preparation
In this methodology, the fi rst phase is text pre-processing. 
The aim of this fi rst phase is to transform the initial corpus 
according to phases 2 and 3 requirements. Various operations 
of selection, cleaning, tokenisation, and segmentation are 
applied. In the experiment we report on, no lemmatisation or 
stemming was used. The corpus so prepared was composed of 
74 450 words (tokens) with a lexicon of 2 831 word types.
Phase 2: Key Word In Context (KWIC) 
extraction (concordance)
Using the corpus pre-processed in phase 1, a concordance 
is made with the pivotal word “Mind”. The KWIC algorithm 
generated 1 798 contextual segments of an average of 7 lines 
each. In order to be able to manually evaluate the results of the 
computer-assisted conceptual analysis, we decided to select in 
the project only a random sampling of the 1 798 contextual 
segments. The sampling algorithm delivered 717 contextual 
segments. This sample is composed of 3 071 words (tokens) 
and 1 527 type words.
Phase 3: KWIC clustering
The concordance is in itself a subtext (of the initial corpus). A 
clustering technique was applied to the concordance results. In 
this project, a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm 
was applied. It generated 83 clusters with a mean 8.3 segments 
per class. It is possible to represent spatially the set of words 
in each class. Figure 1 illustrates such a regrouping for cluster 
1.
Figure 1. Graphical representation of cluster 1 lexicon.
It is often on this type of representation that many numerical 
analyses start their interpretation. One traditional critic 
presented by expert analysts is their great generality and 
ambiguity. This kind of analysis and representation give hints 
on the content of documents, but as such it is diffi cult to use 
for fi ne grained conceptual analysis. It must hence be refi ned. 
It is here that the annotation phase comes into play.
Phase 4: Annotation
The annotation phase allows the expert reader to make more 
explicit the type of information contained in each clusters 
(generated in phase 3). For instance, the interpreter may indicate 
if each cluster is a THEME, a DEFINITION, a DESCRIPTION, 
an EXPLANATION, an ILLUSTRATION, an INFERENCE, or 
what is it MODALITY (epistemic, epistemological, etc.). The 
variety of annotation types is in itself a research object and 
depends on various textual and linguistic theories.
Annotation results
In this abstract, size constraints do not allow us here to present 
detailed results of classifi cation and annotation processes. 
We shall only present a sample on a few segments of three 
classes.
Annotations of cluster 1: The fi rst cluster contained 17 segments 
all of which have received an annotation. Here are samples of 
annotation for two segments of cluster 1. The annotation is 
preceded by the citation itself from the original text.
[SEGMENT NO 512]
“Finally laws of mind divide themselves into laws of the universal 
action of mind and laws of kinds of psychical manifestation.”
ANNOTATION: DEFINITION: the law of mind is a general 
action of the mind and a psychological manifestation

[SEGMENT NO 1457]
“But it differs essentially from materialism, in that, instead of 
supposing mind to be governed by blind mechanical law, it 
supposes the one original law to be the recognized law of mind, 
the law of association, of which the laws of matter are regarded 
as mere special results.”
ANNOTATION: EXPLICATION: The law of mind is not a 
mechanical materialism.
Phase 5: Interpretation
The last phase is the interpretative reading of the annotations. 
Here, the interpreter situates the annotated segments into 
his own interpretative world. He may regroup the various 
types of annotation (DEFINITIONS, EXPLANTIONS, etc.) 
and hence build a specifi c personal data structure on what 
he has annotated. From then on, he may rephrase these in his 
own language and style but most of all situate them in some 
theoretical, historical, analytical, hermeneutic, epistemological, 
etc. perspective. It is the moment where the interpreter 
generates his synthesis of the structure he believes underlies 
the concept.
We present here a sample of the synthesis of conceptual 
analysis assisted by the CARAT process on cluster 1 (the 
concept of “mind” in C.S. Peirce’s writings – cluster 1).
The law of Mind: association
The Peircian theory of MIND postulates that a mind is governed 
by laws. One of these laws, a fundamental one, is associative 
(segment 512). This law describes a habitus acquired by the 
mind when it functions (segment 436).
Association is connectivity
This functioning is one of relation building through connections. 
The connectivity is of a specifi c nature. It realizes a synthesis (à 
la Kant) which is a form of “intellectual” generalisation (segment 
507).
It is physically realized
Such a law is also found in the biological world. It is a law that 
can be understood as accommodation (segment 1436). In 
fact, this law is the specifi c form of the Mind’s dynamic. It is a 
fundamental law. But it is not easy for us to observe it because 
we are victim of a interpretative tradition (segment 1330) that 
understands the laws of mind as laws of nature. This is a typical 
characteristic of an “objective idealism” (segments 1762 and 
1382). The laws of mind do not belong to mechanist materialism 
(segments 90 and 1382).
And there exist a variety of categories
There exist subdivisions of this law. They are related to the 
generalisation process that is realised in infanthood, education, 
and experience. They are intimately related to the growth of 
consciousness (segments 375 and 325).
Conclusion
This research project explores a Computer-Assisted Reading 
and Analysis of Text (CARAT) methodology. The classifi cation 
and annotation strategies manage to regroup systematically 
segments of text that present some content regularity. This 
allows the interpreter to focus directly on the organized 
content of the concept under study. It helps reveal its various 
dimensions (defi nitions, illustrations, explanations, inferences, 
etc.).
Still, this research is ongoing. More linguistic transformations 
should be applied so as to fi nd synonymic expressions of a 
concept. Also, various types of summarization, extraction and 
formal representation of the regularities of each class are to 
be explored in the future.
But the results obtained so far reinstate the pertinence of the 
concordance as a tool for conceptual analysis. But it situates it 
in a mathematical surrounding that aim at unveiling the various 
dimensions of a conceptual structure. Most of all, we believe 
that this methodology may possibly interest expert readers 
and analysis for it gives a strong handle and control on their 
interpretation process although assisting them throughout the 
process.
