 Introduction
Talia is a distributed semantic digital library and publishing 
system, which is specifi cally designed for the needs of the 
scholarly research in the humanities. The system is designed 
for the diverging needs of heterogeneous communities. It is 
strictly based on Semantic Web technology1 and computational 
ontologies for the organisation of knowledge and will help 
the defi nition of a state-ofthe-art research and publishing 
environment for the humanities in general and for philosophy 
in particular.
Talia is developed within the Discovery project, which aims 
at easing the work of philosophy scholars and researchers, 
making a federation of distributed digital archives (nodes) 
each of them dedicated to a specifi c philosopher: Pre-Socratic, 
Diogenes Laertius, Leibniz, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Spinoza, 
and others.
Use Case and Requirements
One of the use cases that Talia should satisfy is called 
The Manuscripts Comparer.The archive contains digital 
reproductions of handwritten manuscripts by one philosopher. 
The scholar wants to browse them like books, navigating by 
chapters and pages. The archive also contains transcriptions of 
the different paragraphs, on which to click to see the correct 
transcription.
Moreover, the scholar is interested in comparing different 
versions of the same thought, placed by the philosopher in 
different paragraphs of his works, so the scholar needs to fi nd 
all those different versions. Finally, he/she can write his own 
remarks on those paragraphs, so that they are published in the 
archive, after a peer review process.
From this use case, we can devise some technical requirements 
that drive the design of Talia:
1. Making metadata remotely available. The metadata content 
of the archives shall be made available through interfaces 
similar to those of URIQA2, which will allow automated 
agents and clients to connect to a Talia node and ask 
for metadata about a resource of interest to retrieve its 
description and related metadata (e.g., the author, the 
resource type, etc.). This type of services enable numerous 
types of digital contents reuse.
2. Querying the system using standard query-languages. It shall 
possible to directly query the distributed archives using the 
SPARQL Semantic Web Query Language. SPARQL provides 
a powerful and standard way to query RDF repositories but 
also enables merging of remote datasets.
3. Transformation of encoded digital contents into RDF. The 
semantic software layer shall provide tools to transform 
textually encoded material, for example the transcription of 
manuscripts in TEI3 format, into RDF.
4. Managing structural metadata. “Structural” metadata 
describes the structure of a document (e.g., its format, its 
publisher, etc.). It shall be necessary to provide tools to 
manage these kinds of metadata.
5. Import and exporting RDF data. It shall be important to 
include facilities in Talia to import and export RDF data 
with standard and well know formats like RDF/XML and 
N-Triples.
Talia should also provide facilities to enrich the content of the 
archives with metadata, whose types and formats depend on 
the kind of source and on the user community which works on 
the data. For example, in some archives, different  versions of 
the same paragraph may exist in different documents. In order 
to allow the users to follow the evolution of that particular 
philosophical thought, the relations among these different 
versions must be captured by the system.
An Overview of the Talia System
Talia is a distributed semantic digital library system which 
combines the features of digital archives management with an 
on-line peer-review system.
The Talia platform stores digital objects, called sources, which 
are identifi ed by their unique and stable URI. Each source 
represents either a work of a philosopher or a fragment of it 
(e.g., a paragraph), and can have one or more data fi les (e.g., 
images or textual documents) connected to it.The system 
also stores information about the sources, which can never be 
removed once published and are maintained in a fi xed state. 
Combined with other long-term preservation techniques, Talia 
allows the scholars to reference their works and gives the 
research community immediate access to new content.

The most innovative aspect of Talia is that for the fi rst time, 
at least in the fi eld of humanities, all the interfaces exposed 
publicly will be based on proven Semantic Web standards 
enabling data interoperability within the Talia federation, and 
eases the data interchange with other systems. Two additional 
features of Talia are the highly customisable Graphic User 
Interface (GUI) and the dynamic contextualisation.
Figure 1: An Example of the Talia User Interface.
The web interface framework, based on modular elements 
called widgets, allows to build GUIs according to requirements 
coming from heterogeneous communities. Widgets can be 
packaged independently and used as building blocks for 
the application’s user interface. In particular, Talia provides 
semantic widgets that interact with an RDF Knowledge Base. 
To customise the site’s appearance, it also would be possible 
to add custom HTML rendering templates. Figure 1 shows a 
screenshot of a Talia’s GUI.
The dynamic contextualisation provides a means for data 
exchange among different and distributed digital libraries 
based on the Talia framework. The dynamic contextualisation 
allows a Talia library (node) to share parts of its RDF graph in 
a peer-to-peer network. By using this mechanism, a node may 
notify another node that a semantic link between them exists, 
and the other node may use this information to update its 
own RDF graph and create a bidirectional connection.
Talia uses computational ontologies and Semantic Web 
technology to help the creation of a state-of-the-art research 
and publishing environment. Talia will provide an innovative 
and adaptable system to enable and ease data interoperability 
and new paradigms for information enrichment, dataretrieval, 
and navigation.
Computational Ontologies
Ontologies have become popular in computer science as a 
means for the organisation of information. This connotation of 
ontology differs from the traditional use and meaning it has in 
philosophy, where ontologies are considered as  A system of 
categories accounting for a certain vision of the world [2]
In computer science, the concept of  (computational) ontology 
evolved from the one fi rst provided by Gruber [3], who 
defi ned an ontology as  a specifi cation of a conceptualisation4 
to a more precise one, extracted from Guarino’s defi nitions 
[4]: A computational ontology is  A formal, partial specifi cation 
of a shared conceptualisation of a world (domain).
Intuitively, a computational ontology is a set of assumptions 
that defi ne the structure of a given domain of interest (e.g., 
philosophy), allowing different people to use the same concepts 
to describe that domain. Talia will use computational ontologies 
to organise information about writings of a philosopher or 
documents (manuscripts, essays, theses, and so on) of authors 
concerning that philosopher.
Related Work
Talia is directly related to the Hyper Platform which was used 
for the HyperNietzsche archive [1], a specialised solution, 
designed for specifi c needs of the Nietzsche communities. 
HyperNietzsche has a fi xed graphical user interface, it does 
not use Semantic Web technology and it is not adaptable for 
different communities with heterogeneous needs.
Talia shares some properties with other semantic digital 
library systems like JeromeDL [5], BRICKS [6], and Fedora 
[7]. However, these projects are mostly focused on the back-
end technology and none of them offers a fl exible and highly 
customisable research and publishing system like Talia.
Conclusion and Future Work
Talia is a novel semantic digital web library system, which aims 
to improve scholarly research in the humanities, in particular 
in the fi eld of philosophy. Thanks to the use of Semantic Web 
technology, Talia represents a very adaptable state-of-the art 
research and publishing system.
The ontologies used in Talia are currently being developed by 
Discovery’s content partners, who are in charge of organising 
their contributions. These ontologies will be part of the fi nal 
core Talia application. At the moment, only a fi rst public demo 
version is available5.
Although Talia is currently intended only for philosophy scholars, 
it should be straightforward to adopt it for humanities, with 
the help of suitably developed ontologies. Using dynamic Ruby 
as programming language and the RubyOnRails framework, 
Talia provides an ideal framework for the rapid development 
of customised semantic digital libraries for the humanities.
