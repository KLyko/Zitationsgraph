In this paper we investigate how currently emerging link 
detection methods can help enrich encoded archival 
descriptions. We discuss link detection methods in general, 
and evaluate the identifi cation of names both within, and 
across, archival descriptions. Our initial experiments suggest 
that we can automatically detect occurrences of person 
names with high accuracy, both within (F-score of 0.9620) and 
across (F-score of 1) archival descriptions. This allows us to 
create (pseudo) encoded archival context descriptions that 
provide novel means of navigation, improving access to the 
vast amounts of archival data.
Introduction
Archival fi nding aids are complex multi-level descriptions 
of the paper trails of corporations, persons and families. 
Currently, fi nding aids are increasingly encoded in XML using 
the standard Encoded Archival Descriptions. Archives can 
cover hundreds of meters of material, resulting in long and 
detailed EAD documents. We use a dataset of 2,886 EAD 
documents from the International Institute of Social History 
(IISG) and 3,119 documents from the Archives Hub, containing 
documents with more than 100,000 words. Navigating in such 
archival fi nding aids becomes non-trivial, and it is easy to loose 
overview of the hierarchical structure. Hence, this may lead to 
the loss of important contextual information for interpreting 
the records.
Archival context may be preserved through the use of authority 
records capturing information about the record creators 
(corporations, persons, or families) and the context of record 
creation. By separating the record creator’s descriptions 
from the records or resources descriptions themselves, we 
can create “links” from all occurrences of the creators to 
this context. The resulting descriptions of record creators 
can be encoded in XML using the emerging Encoded Archival 
Context  (EAC) standard. Currently, EAC has only been applied 
experimentally. One of the main barriers to adoption is that 
it requires substantial effort to adopt EAC. The information 
for the creator’s authority record is usually available in some

form (for example, EAD descriptions usually have a detailed 
fi eld <bioghist> about the archive’s creator). However, linking 
such a context description to occurrences of the creator in 
the archival descriptions requires more structure than that is 
available in legacy data.
Our main aim is to investigate if and how automatic link 
detection methods could help improve archival access. 
Automatic link detection studies the discovery of relations 
between various documents. Such methods have been 
employed to detect “missing” links on the Web and recently 
in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Are link detection 
methods suffi ciently effective to be fruitfully applied to archival 
descriptions? To answer this question, we will experiment on 
the detection of archival creators within and across fi nding aids. 
Based on our fi ndings, we will further discuss how detected 
links can be used to provide crucial contextual information 
for the interpretation of records, and to improve navigation 
within and across fi nding aids.
Link Detection Methods
Links generated by humans are abundant on the World Wide 
Web, and knowledge repositories like the online encyclopedia 
Wikipedia. There are two kinds of links: incoming and outgoing 
links. Substrings of text nodes are identifi ed as anchors and 
become clickable. Incoming links come from text nodes 
of target fi les (destination node) and point to a source fi le 
(origin node), while an outgoing link goes from text node in 
the source document (origin node) to a target fi le (destination 
node). Two assumptions are made: a link from document A to 
document B is a recommendation of B by A, and documents 
linked to each other are related.
To automatically detect whether two nodes are connected, 
it is necessary to search the archives for some string that 
both share. Usually it is only one specifi c and extract string. A 
general approach to automatic link detection is fi rst to detect 
the global similarity between documents. After the relevant 
set of documents has been collected, the local similarity can 
be detected by comparing text segments with other text 
segments in those fi les. In structured documents like archival 
fi nding aids, these text segments are often marked up as 
logical units, whether it be the title <titleproper>, the wrapper 
element <c12> deep down in the fi nding aid, or the element 
<persname> that identifi es some personal names. These units 
are identifi ed and retrieved in XML Element retrieval. The 
identifi cation of relevant anchors is a key problem, as these 
are used in the system’s retrieval models to point to (parts of) 
related fi nding aids. 
Experiment: Name Detection
A specifi c name detection trial with the archive of Joop den 
Uyl (1919-1987), former Labor Party prime minister of the 
Netherlands, is done as a test to deal with this problem. This 
archive consists of 29,184 tokens (with removal of the XML 
markup and punctuation), of which 4,979 are unique, and 
where a token is a sequence of non-space characters. We 
collect a list of the name variants that we expect to encounter: 
“J.M. Den Uyl”, “Joop M. Den Uyl”, “Johannes Marten den Uyl”, 
“Den Uyl”, etc. We construct a regular expression to fetch 
the name variants. The results are depicted in illustration 1, 
which shows the local view of the Joop den Uyl archive in our 
Retrieving EADs More Effectively (README) system.
Illustration 1: Links detected in EAD
The quality of the name detection trial is evaluated with explicit 
feedback, which means manually checking the detected links 
for (1) correctness, (2) error, and (3) whether any links were 
missing. This was done both within fi nding aids, and across 
fi nding aids:
- First, the quality is checked within fi nding aids, by locating 
occurrences of creator Joop den Uyl in his archive. For 
detecting name occurrences within an archive, our simple 
method has a precision of (114/120 =) 0.9500, a recall of 
(114/117 =) 0.9744, resulting in an F-score of 0.9620. Some 
interesting missing links used name variants where the 
prefi x “den” is put behind the last name “Uyl” -- a typical 
Dutch practice. Incorrect links mostly are family members 
occurring the archive, e.g., “Saskia den Uyl”, “E.J. den Uyl-van 
Vessem”, and also “Familie Den Uyl”. Since these names 
occur relatively infrequent, few errors are made. The 
matching algorithm could easily be refi ned based on these 
false positives.

- Second, the same procedure to detect proper names of 
Joop den Uyl is applied across fi nding aids with the related 
archive of “Partij van de Arbeid Tweede-Kamer Fractie 
(1955-1988)” (Dutch MPs from the Labor Party). For 
detecting name occurrences across archives, we obtain a 
perfect precision, recall, and thus F-score of 1.

Concluding Discussion 
In this paper we investigated how currently emerging 
link detection methods can help enrich encoded archival 
descriptions. We discussed link detection methods in general, 
and evaluated the identifi cation of names both within, and 
across, archival descriptions. Our initial experiments suggest 
that we can automatically detect occurrences of person 
names, both within (F-score of 0.9620) and across (F-score 
of 1) archival descriptions. This allows us to create (pseudo) 
encoded archival context (EAC) descriptions that provide 
novel means of navigation and improve access to archival 
fi nding aids. The results of our experiments were promising, 
and can also be expanded to names of organizations, events, 
topics, etc. We expect those to be more diffi cult than personal 
name detection.
There are more uses for detecting cross-links in fi nding aids 
besides creating extra contextual information. Detecting 
missing links is useful for improving the retrieval of separate 
fi nding aids, for example, an archival fi nding aid with many 
detected incoming links may have a higher relevance. Links can 
also offer a search-by-example approach, like given one fi nding 
aids, fi nd all related fi nding aids. A step further is to use the 
cross-links in the categorization of archival data. Concretely 
for historians and other users, who rely on numerous lengthy 
archival documents, new insights can be gained by detecting 
missing cross-links.
