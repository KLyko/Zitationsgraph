 In this paper we report on an incremental approach to 
automated tagging of Greek morphology using a range of 
already existing tools and data. We describe how we engineered 
a system that combines the many freely available resources 
into a useful whole for the purpose of building a searchable 
database of morphologically tagged classical Greek.
The current state of the art in electronic tools for classical Greek 
morphology is represented by Morpheus, the morphological 
analyzer developed by Gregory Crane (Crane 1991). It 
provides all possible parses for a given surface form, and the 
lemmas from which these are derived. The rich morphology of 
Greek, however, results in multiple parses for more than 50% 
of the words (http://grade-devel.uchicago.edu/morphstats.
html). There are fully tagged corpora available for pre-classical 
Greek (early Greek epic, developed for the ‘Chicago Homer’, 
http://www.library.northwestern.edu/homer/) and for New 
Testament Greek, but not for the classical period.
Disambiguating more than half of our 3 million-word corpus 
by hand is not feasible, so we turned to other methods. The 
central element of our approach has been Helmut Schmid’s 
TreeTagger (Schmid 1994, 1995). TreeTagger is a Markov-
model based morphological tagger that has been successfully 
applied to a wide variety of languages. Given training data of 
20,000 words and a lexicon of 350,000 words, TreeTagger 
achieved accuracy on a German news corpus of 97.5%. When 
TreeTagger encounters a form, it will look it up in three places: 
fi rst, it has a lexicon of known forms and their tags. Second, 
it builds from that lexicon a suffi x and prefi x lexicon that 
attempts to serve as a a morphology of the language, so as 
to parse unknown words. In the absence of a known form 
or recognizable suffi x or prefi x, or when there are multiple 
ambiguous parses, it will estimate the tag probabilistically, 
based on the tags of the previous n (typically two) words; 
this stochastic model of syntax is stored as a decision tree 
extracted from the tagged training data.
Since classical Greek presents, prima facie, more of a challenge 
than German, given that it has a richer morphology, and is 
a non-projective language with a complex syntax, we were 
initially unsure whether a Markov model would be capable of 
performing on Greek to any degree of accuracy. A particular 
complicating factor for Greek is the very large tagset: our full 
lexicon contains more than 1,400 tags, making it diffi cult for 
TreeTagger to build a decision tree from small datasets. Czech

(Hajič 1998) is comparable in the number of tags, but has 
lower rates of non-projectivity (compare Bamman and Crane 
2006:72 on Latin).
Thus, for a fi rst experiment, we built a comprehensive lexicon 
consisting of all surface forms occurring in Homer and Hesiod 
annotated with the parses occurring in the hand-disambiguated 
corpus--a subset of all grammatically possible parses--so that 
TreeTagger only had about 740 different possible tags to 
consider. Given this comprehensive lexicon and the Iliad and 
Odyssey as training data (200,000 words), we achieved 96.6% 
accuracy for Hesiod and the Homeric Hymns (see http://
grade-devel.uchicago.edu/tagging.html).
The experiment established that a trigram Markov model was 
in fact capable of modeling Greek grammar remarkably well. 
The good results can be attributed in part to the formulaic 
nature of epic poetry and the large size of the training data, 
but they established the excellent potential of TreeTagger 
for Greek. This high degree of accuracy compares well with 
state-of-the-art taggers for such disparate languages as Arabic, 
Korean, and Czech (Smith et al., 2005).
Unfortunately, the Homeric data form a corpus that is of little 
use for classical Greek. In order to start analyzing classical 
Greek, we therefore used a hand-tagged Greek New Testament 
as our training data (160,000 words). New Testament Greek 
postdates the classical period by some four hundred years, 
and, not surprisingly, our initial accuracy on a 2,000 word 
sample of Lysias (4th century BCE oratory) was only 84% for 
morphological tagging, and performance on lemmas was weak. 
Computational linguists are familiar with the statistic that 
turning to out-of-domain data results in a ten percent loss of 
accuracy, so this result was not entirely unexpected.
At this point one could have decided to hand-tag an 
appropriate classical corpus and discard the out-of-domain 
data. Instead, we decided to integrate the output of Morpheus, 
thereby drastically raising the number of recognized forms 
and possible parses. While we had found that Morpheus alone 
produced too many ambiguous results to be practical as a 
parser, as a lexical resource for TreeTagger it is exemplary. 
TreeTagger’s accuracy on the Lysias sample rose to 88%, with 
much improved recognition of lemmas. Certain common Attic 
constructs, unfortunately, were missed wholesale, but the 
decision tree from the New Testament demonstrated a grasp 
of the fundamentals.
While we are also working on improving accuracy by further 
refi ning the tagging system, so far we have seen the most 
prospects for improvement in augmenting our New Testament 
data with samples from classical Greek: When trained on our 
Lysias sample alone, TreeTagger performed at 96.8% accuracy 
when tested on that same text, but only performed at 88% on 
a new sample. In other words, 2,000 words of in-domain data 
performed no better or worse than 150,000 words of Biblical 
Greek combined with the Morpheus lexicon. We next used a 
combined training set of the tagged New Testament and the 
hand-tagged Lysias sample. In this case, the TreeTagger was 
capable of augmenting the basic decision tree it had already 
extracted from the NT alone with Attic-specifi c constructions. 
Ironically, this system only performed at 96.2% when turned 
back on the training data, but achieved 91% accuracy on the new 
sample (http://grade-devel.uchicago.edu/Lys2.html for results 
on the second sample). This is a substantial improvement given 
the addition of only 2,000 words of text, or less than 2% of 
the total training corpus. In the longer term, we aim at hand-
disambiguating 40,000 words, double that of Schmid (1995), 
but comparable to Smith et al. (2005).
We conclude that automated tagging of classical Greek to 
a high level of accuracy can be achieved with quite limited 
human effort toward hand-disambiguation of in-domain data, 
thanks to the possibility of combining existing morphological 
data and machine learning, which together bootstrap a highly 
accurate morphological analysis. In our presentation we will 
report on our various approaches to improving these results 
still further, such as using a 6th order Markov model, enhancing 
the grammatical specifi city of the tagset, and the results of 
several more iterations of our bootstrap procedure.
