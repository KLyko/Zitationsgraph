The use of computational methods of stylistic analysis to 
consider issues of categorization and authorship is now a 
widely accepted practice. The use of computational techniques 
to analyze style has been less well accepted by traditional 
humanists. The assumption that most humanists make about 
stylistics in general, and about computational stylistics in 
particular, is that it is “concerned with the formal and linguistic 
properties of the text as an isolated item in the work” (Clark 
2005). There are, however, two other points of emphasis that 
are brought to bear on a text through a cognitive approach. 
These are: “that which refers to the points of contact between 
a text, other texts and their readers/listeners”, and “that which 
positions the text and the consideration of its formal and 
psychological elements within a socio-cultural and historical 
context” (Clark 2005). Urszula Clark (2005) argues that these 
apparently independent strands of analysis or interpretive 
practice are an “integrated, indissolvable package” (Clark 
2005).
Computational stylistics of the kind undertaken in this 
study attempts to link statistical fi ndings with this integrated 
indissolvable package; it highlights general trends and features 
that can be used for comparative purposes and also provides 
us with evidence of the peculiarities and creative adaptations 
of an individual user. In this case, the individual user is Elizabeth 
Cary, the author of the earliest extant original play in English by 
a woman, The Tragedy of Mariam, The Fair Queen of Jewry (1613). 
As well as Mariam, the set of texts in the sample includes 
the other 11 closet tragedies associated with the “Sidney 
Circle”, and 48 tragedies written for the public stage. All 
plays in the study were written between 1580 and 1640.1 The 
only other female authored text in the group, Mary Sidney’s 
Antonius, is a translation, as is Thomas Kyd’s Cornelia2.Alexander 
Witherspoon (1924), describes the Sidnean closet tragedies 
as “strikingly alike, and strikingly unlike any other dramas in 
English” (179). He attributes this to the extent to which the 
closet writers draw on the work of French playwright Robert 
Garnier as a model for their own writing. In contrast to other 
plays of the period closet tragedies have not attracted much 
in the way of favourable critical attention. They are, as Jonas 
Barish (1993) suggests, “odd creatures” (19), and Mariam is 
described as one of oddest.
Mariam, as it turns out, is the closet play that is most like a play 
written for the public stage, in terms of the use of function 
words. But this isn’t immediately obvious. Some textual 
preparation was carried out prior to the analysis. Homographs 
were not tagged, but contracted forms throughout the texts 
were expanded so that their constituents appeared as separate 
words. The plays were divided into 2,000 word segments and 
tagged texts were then run through a frequency count using 
Intelligent Archive (IA). A total of 563 two-thousand word 
segments were analysed, 104 of which were from closet plays, 
and 459 from plays written for the public stage. A discriminant 
analysis on the basis of the frequency scores of function words 
demonstrates that there are signifi cant differences between 
the two groups of plays. Table 1 shows the classifi cation results 
for a discriminant analysis using the full set of function words. 
In this test, 561 of the 563 segments were classifi ed correctly. 
One segment from each group was misclassifi ed. Thus 99.6% 
of cross-validated grouped cases were correctly classifi ed on 
the basis of function words alone. The test also showed that 
only 38 of the 241 function word variables were needed to 
successfully discriminate between the groups.

A principal component analysis (PCA) gives additional 
information about the differences and similarities between 
the two sets. An Independent-samples T-test was used to 
identify the variables most responsible for the differences. This 
process picked out 54 variables that were signifi cant at the 
level of 0.0001 and these 54 variables were used for the PCA. 
PCA looks to defi ne factors that can be described as most 
responsible for differences between groups. For this text, the 
texts were broken into 4000 word segments to ensure that 
frequencies remained high enough for reliable analysis. This 
produced 268 segments in total (50 closet segments and 218 
public play segments). Figure 2 plots the 54 most discriminating 
words-types for the fi rst two eigenvectors (based on factor 
loadings for each variable) and shows which words behave 
most like or unlike each other in the sample. 
In Figure 3 the eigenvalues from the component matrix have 
been multiplied through the standardised frequencies for each 
of the 4,000 word segments to show which segments behave 
most like or unlike each other on the fi rst two principal 
components. The scores that produce Figure 3 are “the sum of 
the variable counts for each text segment, after each count is 
multiplied by the appropriate coeffi cient” (Burrows and Craig 
1994 68). High counts on word variables at the western end of 
Figure 2 and low counts on word variables at the eastern end 
bring the text segments at the western end of Figure 3 to their 
positions on the graph. The reverse is true for text segments 
on the eastern side of Figure 3. We can see that the far western 
section of Figure 3 is populated predominantly with public play 
segments, and that the eastern side of the y-axis is populated 
exclusively with segments from stage plays. It is clear that in 
the case of these most discriminating variables, the segments 
from Mariam are the closet segments most intermingled with 
the segments written for the public stage.
Looking at Figure 2 there is evidence of an “emphasis on 
direct personal exchange” in western section of the graph. 
In the opposite section of the graph there is evidence of a 
more disquisitory style of language that is “less personal”, with 
“markers of plurality, past time, and a more connected syntax” 
(Burrows and Craig 1994 70). It may be that the results refl ect 
the kinds of observations that critics have long made about 
early modern closet tragedy and tragedy written for the public 
stage, suggesting that “word-counts serve as crude but explicit 
markers of the subtle stylistic patterns to which we respond 
when we read well” (Burrows and Craig 1994 70). It may also 
be the case, however, that we can link these statistical results 
with more interpretive work.
Returning to Mariam, the function words which most distinguish 
the Mariam segments from the rest of the segments of both 
closet and public plays, are the auxiliary verbs did (8.4) and 
had (6.9). In the case of did over 500 of the segments have 
scores of between -1 and 2. Six of the eight of the Mariam 
segments are extremely high (the two middle segments of 
Mariam have fairly average z-scores for did). The lowest score 
occurs in segment 4, when Mariam is conspicuously absent 
from the action. A very similar pattern emerges for had. In 
conventional grammars do and other auxiliaries including be 
and have are viewed as meaningless morphemes that serve 
a grammatical purpose. Langacker argues that serving a 
specifi able grammatical function is not inherently incompatible 
with being a meaningful element (1987 30).
Cognitive linguistics suggests that function word schemas 
interact with each other to produce what Talmy calls a 
“dotting” of semantic space (1983 226), and that they “play 
a basic conceptual structuring role” (Talmy 88 51). In this 
framework, auxiliaries are viewed as profi ling a process 
– they determine which entity is profi led by a clause and 
impose a particular construal. Langacker argues, for example, 
that do always conveys some notion of activity or some kind 
of volitionality or control on the part of the subject. Have 
designates a subjectively construed relation of anteriority and 
current relevance to a temporal reference point (Langacker 
1991 239). Talmy argues that have can be understood in terms 
of force dynamics patterns; it “expresses indirect causation 
either without an intermediate volitional entity…or… with

such an entity” (1988 65). Talmy goes further to suggest that 
the “concepts” of force dynamics are “extended by languages 
to their semantic treatment of psychological elements and 
interactions” (1988 69).
Bringing the tools of cognitive linguistics to bear on the results 
of computational analysis of texts can provide a framework 
that validates the counting of morphemes like did and had. 
The same framework may also shed light on questions of 
interpretation. This approach appears to provide a disciplined 
way of identifying and analyzing the linguistic features that are 
foregrounded in a text, while supporting their interpretation 
as part of an integrated, indissolvable package.

Cornelia and The Spanish Tragedy are included in the study.
2 John Burrows (2002) explores some of the issues around 
translation and whether it can be “assumed that poets stamp their 
stylistic signatures as fi rmly on translation as their original work” 
(679). Burrows found that Drydan was able to “conceal his hand”, but 
in other cases it appeared that a “stylisitic signature”, even in the case 
of a translation, remained detectable (696).
