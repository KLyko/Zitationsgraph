This paper presents the results of a pilot project aimed at 
the development of automatic techniques for the discovery 
of salient technical terminology in a corpus of Latin texts. 
These texts belong to the domain of mechanics and date 
from the last quarter of the sixteenth and the fi rst quarter 
of the seventeenth century, a period of intense intellectual 
activity in which engineers and scientists explored the limits 
of the Aristotelian and Archimedean paradigms in mechanics. 
The tensions that arose ultimately were resolved by the new 
“classical mechanics” inaugurated by Newton’s Principia in 
1687 (cf. Damerow et al. 2004).
The work presented here forms part of a larger research 
project aimed at developing new computational techniques to 
assist historians in studying fi ne-grained developments in long-
term intellectual traditions, such as the tradition of Western 
mechanics that begins with the pseudo-Aristotelian Problemata 
Mechanica (ca. 330 B.C.E.). This research is integrated with two 
larger institutional projects: the working group “Mental Models 
in the History of Mechanics” at the Max Planck Institute for 
the History of Science in Berlin, and the German DFG-funded 
Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 644 “Transformations 
of Antiquity.”
The purpose of this paper is to present initial results regarding 
the development of effi cient methods for technical term 
discovery in Early Modern scientifi c Latin. The focus is on the 
identifi cation of term variants and on term enrichment. The 
methodology employed is inspired by Jacquemin (2001), whose 
approach allows for the use of natural language processing 
techniques without the need for full syntactic parsing, which is 
currently not technically feasible for Latin.
The present paper extends prior work in term discovery 
along two vectors. First, work in term discovery has primarily 
addressed the languages of Western Europe (especially 
English and French), with some work also in Chinese and 
Japanese. Latin presents some typological features that require 
modifi cations to established techniques. Chief among these is 
the rich infl ectional morphology (both nominal and verbal) 
of Latin, which is a language of the synthetic type. Latin also 
exhibits non-projectivity, i.e. syntactic constituents may be 
represented non-continuously (with the intrusion of elements 
from foreign constituents). Although the non-projectivity of 
Renaissance Latin is considerably less than what is found in the 
artistic prose (and a fortiori poetry) of the Classical language 
(Bamman and Crane 2006), term detection must proceed 
within a framework that allows for both non-projectivity and 
(relatively) free word order within constituents.

Second, researchers in the fi eld of term discovery have focused 
almost exclusively on contemporary scientifi c corpora in 
domains such as biomedicine. In contemporary scientifi c 
literature, technical terms are characterized by a particularly 
high degree of denotative monosemicity, exhibit considerable 
stability, and follow quite rigid morphological, syntactic, and 
semantic templates. Although these characteristics are also 
applicable to the terminology of Latin scientifi c texts, they are 
applicable to a lesser degree. In other words, the distinction 
between technical terminology and ordinary language 
vocabulary is less clear cut than in the case of contemporary 
scientifi c and technical language. The lesser degree of 
monosemicity, stability, and structural rigidity of terminology 
holds implications for automatic term discovery in corpora 
earlier than the twentieth (or at least nineteenth) century.
The corpus of Early Modern mechanics texts in Latin is well-
designed for carrying out experiments in adapting established 
techniques of term discovery to historical corpora. Mechanics 
is by this time a scientifi c discipline that possesses an extensive 
repertoire of characteristic concepts and terminology. Thus 
it is broadly comparable to contemporary scientifi c corpora, 
while still presenting unique features that merit special 
investigation. Several thousand pages of text are available in 
XML format, which have been digitized by the Archimedes 
Project, an international German/American digital library 
venture jointly funded by the DFG and NSF. It will be possible 
to extend future work to a multilingual context, by examining 
in addition closely-related vernacular works (in Italian, Spanish, 
and German) that are contemporary with the Latin corpus. 
(Some of these are translations and commentaries.)
The set of technical terminology discovered by the 
methods presented in this paper is intended to further the 
computationally-assisted framework for exploring conceptual 
change and knowledge transfer in the history of science 
that has been described by Hyman (2007). This framework 
employs latent semantic analysis (LSA) and techniques for 
the visualization of semantic networks, allowing change in the 
semantic associations of terms to be studied within a historical 
corpus. The concluding section of the present paper will survey 
the applications of technical term discovery within historical 
corpora for the study of the confl ict, competition, evolution, 
and replacement of concepts within a scientifi c discipline and 
will suggest potential applications for other scholars who are 
concerned with related problems.
