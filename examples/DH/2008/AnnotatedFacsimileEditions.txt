Introduction
Facsimile images form a major component in many digital 
editing projects. Well-known projects such as the Blake 
Archive [Eaves 2007] and the Rossetti Archive [McGann 2007] 
use facsimile images as the primary entry point to accessing 
the visually rich texts in their collections. Even for projects 
focused on transcribed electronic editions, it is now standard 
practice to include high-resolution facsimile. 
Encoding standards and text processing toolkits have been 
the focus of signifi cant research. Tools, standards, and formal 
models for encoding information in image-based editions have 
only recently begun to receive attention. Most work in this 
area has centered on the digitization and presentation of visual 
materials [Viscomi 2002] or detailed markup and encoding 
of information within a single image [Lecolinet 2002, Kiernan 
2004, Dekhtyar 2006]. Comparatively little has been work has 
been done on modeling the large-scale structure of facsimile 
editions. Typically, the reading interface that presents a facsimile 
determines its structure. 
Separating the software used to model data from that used 
to build user interfaces has well-known advantages for both 
engineering and digital humanities practices. To achieve this 
separation, it is necessary to develop a model of a facsimile 
edition that is independent of the interface used to present 
that edition.
In this paper, we present a unifi ed approach for representing 
linguistic, structural, and graphical content of a text as an 
Annotated Facsimile Edition (AFED). This model grows out of 
our experience with several digital facsimile edition projects 
over more than a decade, including the Cervantes Project 
[Furuta 2001], the Digital Donne [Monroy 2007a], and the 
Nautical Archaeology Digital Library [Monroy 2007b]. Our work 
on these projects has emphasized the need for an intuitive 
conceptual model of a digital facsimile. This model can then 
serve as the basis for a core software module that can be 
used across projects without requiring extensive modifi cation 
by software developers. Drawing on our prior work we have 
distilled fi ve primary goals for such a model:

• Openness: Scholars’ focused research needs are highly 
specifi c, vary widely between disciplines, and change over 
time. The model must accommodate new information needs 
as they arise.

of collected poems (in two volumes) represented 
as an annotated facsimile edition.
• Non-hierarchical: Facsimile editions contain some 
information that should be presented hierarchically, but 
they cannot be adequately represented as a single, properly 
nested hierarchy. 
• Restructuring: A facsimile is a representation of the 
physical form of a document, but the model should enable 
applications to restructure the original form to meet 
specifi c needs. 
• Alignment: Comparison between varying representations 
of the same work is a fundamental task of humanities 
research. The model must support alignment between 
facsimiles of different copies of a work. 
Annotated Facsimile Editions
The Annotated Facsimile Edition (AFED) models the macro 
level structure of facsimile editions, representing them as a 
stream of images with annotations over that stream. Figure 1 
shows a simplifi ed diagram illustrating a two-volume edition 
of collected poems. Annotations encode the structure of the 
document and properties of the structural elements they 
represent. Separate annotation streams encode multiple 
analytical perspectives. For example, in fi gure 1, the annotations 
shown below the image stream describe the physical structure 
of the edition (volumes, pages, and lines) while the annotations 
shown above the image stream describe the poetic structure 
(poems, titles, epigraphs, stanzas). Annotations within a 
single analytical perspective—but not those from different 
perspectives—follow a hierarchical structure. 
The Image Stream
The image stream intuitively corresponds to the sequential 
ordering of page images in a traditional printed book. These 
images, however, need not represent actual “pages.” An image 
might show a variety of artifacts including an opening of a 
book, a fragment of a scroll, or an unbound leaf of manuscript 
notes. While it is natural to treat facsimile images sequentially, 
any particular linear sequence represents an implementation 
decision—a decision that may not be implied by the 
physical document. For example, an editor may choose to 
arrange an edition of letters according to the date written, 
recipient, or thematic content. The image stream, therefore, 
is an implementation detail of the model. The structure of the 
edition is specifi ed explicitly by the annotations.
Annotation Management
Perspective Analytical perspective e.g., physical structure, narrative 
elements, poetic.
Type The name of this type of annotation, e.g., page, volume, 
chapter, poem, stanza
Start Index The index into the image stream where this annotation 
starts.
Stop Index The index into the image stream where this annotation 
ends.
Sequence A number for resolving the sequence of multiple 
annotations on the same page.
Content
Canonical Name A canonical name that uniquely identifi es this content 
relative to a domain specifi c classifi cation scheme.
Display Name The name to be displayed when referring to an instance 
this annotation
Properties A set of key/value pairs providing domain specifi c 
information about the annotation.
Transcriptions A set of transcriptions of the content that this annotation 
specifi es.
Structural Information
Parent A reference to the parent of this annotation.
Children A list of references to the children of this annotation
Table 1: Information represented by an annotation.
Many historical texts exist only as fragments. Many more have 
suffered damage that results in the lost of a portion of the 
original text. Despite this damage, the general content and 
characteristics of the text may be known or hypothesized based 
on other sources. In other cases, while the original artifact may 
exist, a digital representation of all or part of the artifact may 
unavailable initially. To enable scholars to work with missing or 
unavailable portions of a facsimile, we introduce the notion of 
an abstract image. An abstract image is simply a placeholder 
for a known or hypothesized artifact of the text for which no 
image is available. Annotations attach to abstract images in the 
same way they attach to existing images. 
Annotations
Annotations are the primary means for representing structural 
and linguistic content in the AFED. An annotation identifi es a 
range of images and specifi es properties about those images. 
Table 1 lists the information specifi ed by each annotation. 
Properties in italics are optional. As shown in this table, 
annotations support three main categories of information: 
annotation management, content, and structural information.

The annotation management and structural information 
categories contain record keeping information. Structural 
information describes the hierarchical structure of annotation 
within an analytical perspective. The annotation management 
category specifi es the annotation type and identifi es the image 
content referenced by the annotation. The sequence number is 
an identifi er used by AFED to determine the relative ordering 
of multiple annotations that have the same starting index. 
AFED is agnostic to the precise semantics of this value. The 
annotation type determines these semantics. For example, 
a paragraph annotation may refer to the paragraph number 
relative to a page, chapter, or other structural unit.
The content category describes the item referenced by the 
annotation. Annotations support two naming conventions. To 
facilitate comparison between documents, an annotation may 
specify a canonical name according to a domain specifi c naming 
convention. Canonical names usually do not match the name 
given to the referenced item by the artifact itself and are rarely 
appropriate for display to a general audience. Accordingly, the 
annotation requires the specifi cation of a name suitable for 
display. 
Descriptive metadata can be specifi ed as a set of key/value 
properties. In addition to descriptive metadata, annotations 
support multiple transcriptions. Multiple transcriptions allow 
alternate perspectives of the text; for example, a paleographic 
transcription to support detailed linguistic analysis and a 
normalized transcription to facilitate reading. Transcriptions 
may also include translations. 
AFED’s annotation mechanism defi nes a high-level syntactical 
structure that is suffi cient to support the basic navigational 
needs of most facsimile projects. By remaining agnostic 
to semantic details, it allows for fl exible, project specifi c 
customization. Where projects need to support user 
interactions that go beyond typical navigation scenarios, these 
interactions can be integrated into the user interface without 
requiring changes to the lower-level tools used to access the 
facsimile.
Discussion
AFED has proven to be a useful model in our work. We have 
deployed a proof of concept prototype based on the AFED 
model. Several of the facsimile editions constructed by the 
Cervantes Project use this prototype behind the scenes. Given its 
success in these reader’s interfaces, we are working to develop 
a Web-based editing toolkit. This application will allow editors 
to quickly defi ne annotations and use those annotations to 
describe a facsimile edition. We anticipate completing this tool 
by the summer of 2008.
By using multiple, hierarchical annotation streams, AFED’s 
expressive power falls under the well-studied class of 
document models, known as OHCO (ordered hierarchy of 
content objects). Specifi cally, it is an instance of a revised form 
of this generic model known as OHCO-3, [Renear 1996]. 
Whereas most prior research and development associated 
with the OHCO model has focused on XML-based, transcribed 
content, we have applied this model to the task of representing 
macro-level structures in facsimile editions. 
Focusing on macro-level document structure partially isolates 
the AFED model from the non-hierarchical nature of documents 
both in terms of the complexity of the required data structures, 
and in terms of providing simplifi ed model to facilitate system 
implementation. If warranted by future applications, we can 
relax AFED’s hierarchical constraint. Relaxing this constraint 
poses no problems with the current prototype; however, 
further investigation is needed to determine potential benefi ts 
and drawbacks.
In addition to macro-level structures, a document model 
that strives to represent the visual content of a document 
for scholarly purposes must also account for fi ne-grained 
structures present in individual images and provide support 
for encoded content at a higher level of detail. We envision 
using the AFED model in conjunction with models tailored for 
these low-level structures. We are working to develop a model 
for representing fi ne-grained structure in visually complex 
documents grounded in spatial hypermedia theory.
