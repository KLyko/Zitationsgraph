Popular methods for cultural heritage digitization include 
fl atbed scanning and high-resolution photography. The 
current paradigm for the digitization and dissemination of 
library collections is to create high-resolution digital images 
as facsimiles of primary source materials. While these 
approaches have provided new levels of accessibility to many 
cultural artifacts, they usually assume that the object is more 
or less fl at, or at least viewable in two dimensions. However, 
this assumption is simply not true for many cultural heritage 
objects.
For several years, researchers have been exploring digitization 
of documents beyond 2D imaging. Three-dimensional surface 
acquisition technology has been used to capture the shape 
of non-planar texts and build 3D document models (Brown 
2000, Landon 2006), where structured light techniques are 
used to acquire 3D surface geometry and a high-resolution 
still camera is used to capture a 2D texture image.
However, there are many documents that are impossible to 
scan or photograph in the usual way. Take for example the 
entirety of the British Library’s Cotton Collection, which was 
damaged by a fi re in 1731 (Tite 1994, Prescott 1997, Seales 
2000, Seales 2004). Following the fi re most of the manuscripts 
in this collection suffered from both fi re and water damage, 
and had to be physically dismantled and then painstakingly 
reassembled. Another example is the collection of papyrus 
scrolls that are in the Egyptian papyrus collection at the British 
Museum (Smith 1987, Andrews 1990, Lapp 1997). Because of 
damage to the outer shells of some of these scrolls the text 
enclosed therein have never been read - unrolling the fragile 
material would destroy them.
Certain objects can be physically repaired prior to digitization. 
However, the fact is that many items are simply too fragile 
to sustain physical restoration. As long as physical restoration 
is the only option for opening such opaque documents, 
scholarship has to sacrifi ce for preservation, or preservation 
sacrifi ce for scholarship.
The famous Herculaneum collection is an outstanding 
example of the scholarship/preservation dichotomy (Sider 
2005). In the 1750s, the excavation of more than a thousand 
scorched papyrus rolls from the Villa dei Papiri (the Villa of 
the Papyri) in ancient Herculaneum caused great excitement 
among contemporary scholars, for they held the possibility

of the rediscovery of lost masterpieces by classical writers. 
However, as a result of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79 
that destroyed Pompeii and also buried nearby Herculaneum, 
the papyrus rolls were charred severely and are now extremely 
brittle, frustrating attempts to open them.
A number of approaches have been devised to physically open 
the rolls, varying from mechanical and “caloric”, to chemical 
(Sider 2005). Substrate breakages caused during the opening 
create incomplete letters that appear in several separate 
segments, which makes reading them very diffi cult. Some efforts 
have been made to reconstruct the scrolls, including tasks such 
as establishing the relative order of fragments and assigning to 
them an absolute sequence (Janko 2003). In addition, multi-
spectral analysis and conventional image processing methods 
have helped to reveal signifi cant previously unknown texts. 
All in all, although these attempts have introduced some new 
works to the canon, they have done so at the expense of the 
physical objects holding the text.
Given the huge amount of labor and care it takes to physically 
unroll the scrolls, together with the risk of destruction caused 
by the unrolling, a technology capable of producing a readable 
image of a rolled-up text without the need to physically open 
it is an attractive concept. Virtual unrolling would offer an 
obvious and substantial payoff.
In summary, there is a class of objects that are inaccessible 
due to their physical construction. Many of these objects may 
carry precise contents which will remain a mystery unless and 
until they are opened. In most cases, physical restoration is 
not an option because it is too risky, unpredictable, and labor 
intensive.
This dilemma is well suited for advanced computer vision 
techniques to provide a safe and effi cient solution. The EDUCE 
project (Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and 
Exploration) is developing a general restoration approach 
that enables access to those impenetrable objects without 
the need to open them. The vision is to apply this work 
ultimately to documents such as those described above, and 
to allow complete analysis while enforcing continued physical 
preservation.
Proof of Concept
With the assistance of curators from the Special Collections 
Library at the University of Michigan, we were given access to 
a manuscript from the 15th century that had been dismantled 
and used in the binding of a printed book soon after its 
creation. The manuscript is located in the spine of the binding, 
and consists of seven or so layers that were stuck together, 
as shown in fi gure 1. The handwritten text on the top layer is 
recognizable from the book of Ecclesiastes. The two columns of 
texts correspond to Eccl 2:4/2:5 (2:4 word 5 through 2:5 word 
6) and Eccl 2:10 (word 10.5 through word 16). However, it was 
not clear what writing appears on the inner layers, or whether 
they contain any writing at all. We tested this manuscript using 
methods that we had refi ned over a series of simulations and 
real-world experiments, but this experiment was our fi rst on 
a bona fi de primary source.
Figure 1: Spine from a binding made of 
a fi fteenth-century manuscript.
Following procedures which will be discussed in more detail 
in our presentation, we were able to bring out several layers 
of text, including the text on the back of the top layer. Figure 2 
shows the result generated by our method to reveal the back 
side of the top layer which is glued inside and inaccessible. The 
left and right columns were identifi ed as Eccl. 1:16 and 1:11 
respectively.
To verify our fi ndings, conservation specialists at the 
University of Michigan uncovered the back side of the top 
layer by removing the fi rst layer from the rest of the strip of 
manuscript. The process was painstaking, in order to minimize 
damage, and it took an entire day. First, the strip was soaked in 
water for a couple of hours to dissolve the glue and enhance 
the fl exibility of the material which was fragile due to age; this 
added a risk of the ink dissolving, although the duration and 
water temperature were controlled to protect against this 
happening. Then, the fi rst layer was carefully pulled apart from 
the rest of the manuscript with tweezers. The process was 
very slow to avoid tearing the material. Remaining residue was 
scraped off gently.
The back side of the top layer is shown in fi gure 3. Most of 
the Hebrew characters in the images are legible and align well 
with those in the digital images of the manuscript. The middle 
rows show better results than the rows on the edges. That is 
because the edge areas were damaged in structure, torn and 
abraded, and that degraded the quality of the restoration.

the top layer, identifi ed as Eccl. 1:16 and 1:11.

layer, once removed from the binding.
Without applying the virtual unwrapping approach, the choices 
would be either to preserve the manuscript with the hidden 
text unknown or to destroy it to read it. In this case, we fi rst 
read the text with non-invasive methods then disassembled 
the artifact in order to confi rm our readings.
Presentation of Ongoing Work
In November 2007, representatives from the Sorbonne in 
Paris will bring several unopened papyrus fragments to the 
University of Kentucky to undergo testing following similar 
procedures to those that resulted in the uncovering of the 
Ecclesiastes text in the fi fteenth-century manuscript. And in 
June 2008, a group from the University of Kentucky will be at 
the British Museum scanning and virtually unrolling examples 
from their collections of papyrus scrolls. This presentation at 
Digital Humanities 2008 will serve not only as an overview 
of the techniques that led to the successful test described 
above, but will also be an extremely up-to-date report of the 
most recent work of the project. We look forward to breaking 
down the dichotomy between preservation and scholarship 
for this particular class of delicate objects.
