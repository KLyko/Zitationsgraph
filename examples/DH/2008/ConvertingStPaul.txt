In researching the textual phenomena and scribal practices of 
late-medieval drama I have been creating an electronic edition 
of The Conversion of St Paul. This late-medieval verse play 
survives only in Bodleian MS Digby 133. My edition attempts 
to be a useful scholarly work, which where possible leverages 
existing resources to create an agile interoperable resource. 
In undertaking this work I have been able to explore a number 
of issues related to the creation of such editions which may 
have pedagogic benefi t as a case study to others. These include 
shortcuts to speed up the creation of the initial edition, the 
generation of additional resources based solely on a single 
XML encoded text, the use of new mechanisms in the TEI 
P5 Guidelines, and the exploitation of stand-off markup to 
experiment with seamlessly incorporating external resources. 
The TEI P5 Guidelines have been followed in production of 
this edition, and specifi cally I have used a number of features 
which are new additions to TEI P5 and which others may not 
yet be familiar. It was developed in tandem with early drafts of 
the Guidelines, in part to test some of the features we were 
adding.
These include:
• A customised view of the TEI expressed as a TEI ODD fi le. 
This allows generation not only of constrained TEI Schemas 
and DTDs but also project specifi c documentation through 
the TEI’s ODD processor ‘Roma’.
• A manuscript description of MS Digby 133, and the 
manuscript item of this play, using the TEI’s new module for 
manuscript description metadata.
• Consistent and in-depth use of the new <choice> 
structure to provide alternative textual information at 
individual points in the text. Specifi cally, in this highly-
abbreviated medieval text, this has been used to provide 
both abbreviations and expansions which then can be 
toggled in the rendered version. Regularisation of medieval 
spelling has been handled with stand-off markup, but could 
equally have been incorporated into <choice>
• Inside abbreviations and expansions, the new elements 
<am> (abbreviation marker) and <ex> (expanded text) 
have been used. This allows the marking and subsequent 
display of abbreviation marks in a diplomatic edition view 
and italicised rendering of the supplied text in the expanded 
view.
• The edition also records information about the digital 
photographic surrogate provided by the Bodleian using the 
new <facsimile> element. While this will also allow linking 
from the text to particular zones of the images, this has not 
yet been undertaken..
• The edition also uses various new URI-based pointing 
mechanisms and datatype constraints new to TEI P5.
To speed up the creation of the edition I took an out of 
copyright printed version of the text (Furnivall 1896) which 
was scanned and passed through optical character recognition. 
This was then carefully corrected and proofread letter-by-
letter against freely available (though restrictively licensed) 
images made available online by the Bodleian Library, Oxford 
(at http://image.ox.ac.uk/show?collection=bodleian&manu
script=msdigby133). I used OpenOffi ce to create the initial 
edition, with specialised formatting used to indicate various 
textual and editorial phenomena such as expanded material, 
superscript abbreviation markers, stage directions, and notes. 
The up-scaling of the markup through using this presentational 
markup was achieved when I converted it, using XSLT, to very 
basic TEI XML. While this is a quick method of data entry 
familiar to many projects, it only tends to work successfully 
in non-collaborative projects where the consistency of the 
application of formatting can be more easily controlled as any 
inconsistencies can lead to signifi cant manual correction of the 
generated XML.
Another of the issues I was interested in exploring in 
this edition was the use of stand-off markup to create 
interoperable secondary resources and how this might effect 
the nature of scholarly editing. While I could have stored much 
of this information I needed in the edition itself, I wanted to 
experiment with storing it in external fi les and linking them 
together by pointing into the digital objects. The motivation for 
this comes from a desire to explore notions of interoperability 
since stand-off markup methodology usually leaves the base 
text untouched and stores additional information in separate 
fi les. As greater numbers of good scholarly academic resources 
increasingly become available in XML, the pointing into a 
number of resources, and combining these together to form 
an additional greater resource is becoming more common. 
Stand-off markup was used here partly to experiment with the 
idea of creating an interoperable fl exible resource, that is an 
‘agile edition’. For example, an edition can be combined with 
associated images, a glossary or word list, or other external 
resources such as dictionaries. In the case of this edition, I 
generated a word list (encoded using the TEI dictionaries 
module) using XSLT. The word list included any distinct 
orthographic variants in the edition. This was based on a ‘deep-
equals’ comparison which compared not only the spelling of 
words, but all of their descendant elements, and thus captured 
differences in abbreviation/expansion inside individual words. 
The location of individual instances of orthographic variance 
in the edition could easily have been stored along with the 
entry in the word list. However, since part of the point was to 
experiment with handling stand-off markup, I stored these in a

third fi le whose only purpose was to record <link> elements 
pointing both to an entry in the word list and every single 
instance of this word in the edition. This linking was done using 
automatically-generated xml:id attributes on each word and 
word list entry. This enables a number of usability features. 
The clicking on any individual word in the edition takes you 
to its corresponding entry in the word list. From any entry in 
the word list you can similarly get back to any other individual 
instance of that word in the edition. Moreover the word list 
entry also contains an optionally displayed concordance of 
that word to allow easy comparison of its use in context.
In addition to using resources created by myself, it was a desired 
aim of this investigation into stand-off markup to use external 
resources. The most appropriate freely-available resource in 
this case is the Middle English Dictionary (MED), created by 
the University of Michigan. As this scholarly edition was being 
created in my spare time, I did not want to exhaustively check 
orthographic words in my edition against the MED and link 
directly to the correct senses. While that is certainly possible, 
and should be the recommended text-critical practice, it 
would take a signifi cant amount of time and be prone to error. 
Instead I desired to pass a regularised form of the word to the 
MED headword search engine, and retrieve the results and 
incorporate them dynamically into the display of the entry for 
that word in the word list. However, this proved impossible 
to do from the MED website because their output, despite 
claiming to be XHTML, was not well-formed. Luckily, they 
were willing to supply me with an underlying XML fi le which 
provided not only headwords, but also their various different 
orthographic forms and the MED id number to which I could 
link directly. Thus, I was able to achieve the same effect as 
transcluding the MED search results by reimplementing the 
functionality of their search directly in my XSLT and thus 
providing pre-generated links in each entry to possible 
headwords in the MED. While successful for my resource, in 
terms of true interoperability it is really a failure, one which 
helps to highlight some of the problems encountered when 
pointing into resources over which you have no control.
The proposed paper will describe the process of creation 
of the edition, the benefi ts and drawbacks of using stand-
off markup in this manner, its linking to external resources, 
and how the same processes might be used in either legacy 
data migration or the creation of new editions. One of the 
concluding arguments of the paper is that the advent of new 
technologies which make the longpromised ability for the 
interoperability of resources that much easier, also encourages 
(and is dependent upon) us making our own existing materials 
accessible in a compatible manner.
