The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of e-Science 
and e-Research activities for the arts and humanities in the UK. 
It will focus on research projects and trends and will not cover 
the institutional infrastructure to support them. In particular, 
we shall explore the methodological discussions laid out in 
the Arts and Humanities e-Science Theme, jointly organised 
by the Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre and the 
e-Science Institute in Edinburgh (http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/
themes/theme_06/). The second focus of the paper will be the 
current and future activities within the Arts and Humanities 
e-Science Initiative in the UK and their methodological 
consequences (http://www.ahessc.ac.uk).
The projects presented so far are all good indicators of what 
the future might deliver, as ‘grand challenges’ for the arts and 
humanities e-Science programme such as the emerging data 
deluge (Hey and Trefethen 2003). The Bush administration will 
have produced over 100 million emails by the end of its term 
(Unsworth 2006). These can provide the basis for new types of 
historical and socio-political research that will take advantage 
of computational methods to deal with digital data. However, 
for arts and humanities research an information is not just an 
information. Complicated semantics underlie the archives of 
human reports. As a simple example, it cannot be clear from 
the email alone which Bush administration or even which Iraq 
war are under consideration. Moreover, new retrieval methods 
for such data must be intuitive for the user and not based on 
complicated metadata schemes. They have to be specifi c in 
their return and deliver exactly that piece of information the 
researcher is interested in. This is fairly straightforward for 
structured information if it is correctly described, but highly 
complex for unstructured information. Arts and humanities 
additionally need the means to on-demand reconfi gure the 
retrieval process by using computational power that changes 
the set of information items available from texts, images, 
movies, etc. This paper argues that a specifi c methodological 
agenda in arts and humanities e-Science has been developing 
over the past two years and explores some of its main tenets. 
We offer a chronological discussion of two phases in the 
methodological debates about the applicability of e-science 
and e-research to arts and humanities.
The fi rst phase concerns the methodological discussions 
that took place during the early activities of the Theme. A 
series of workshops and presentations about the role of e-
Science for arts and humanities purported to make existing 
e-science methodologies applicable to this new fi eld and 
consider the challenges that might ensue (http://www.nesc.
ac.uk/esi/themes/theme_06/community.htm). Several events 
brought together computer scientists and arts and humanities 
researchers. Further events (fi nished by the time of Digital 
Humanities 2008) will include training events for postgraduate 
students and architectural studies on building a national e-
infrastructure for the arts and humanities.
Due to space limitations, we cannot cover all the early 
methodological discussions during the Theme here, but 
focus on two, which have been fruitful in uptake in arts and 
humanities: Access Grid and Ontological Engineering. A 
workshop discussed alternatives for video-conferencing in 
the arts and humanities in order to establish virtual research 
communities. The Access Grid has already proven to be of 
interest in arts and humanities research. This is not surprising, 
as researchers in these domains often need to collaborate 
with other researchers around the globe. Arts and humanities 
research often takes place in highly specialised domains and 
subdisciplines, niche subjects with expertise spread across 
universities. The Access Grid can provide a cheaper alternative 
to face-to-face meetings.
However, online collaboration technologies like the Access 
Grid need to be better adapted to the specifi c needs of 
humanities researchers by e.g. including tools to collaboratively 
edit and annotate documents. The Access Grid might be a good 
substitute to some face-to-face meetings, but lacks innovative 
means of collaboration, which can be especially important in 
arts and humanities research. We should aim to realise real 
multicast interaction, as it has been done in VNC technology 
or basic wiki technology. These could support new models of 
collaboration in which the physical organisation of the Access 
Grid suite can be accommodated to specifi c needs that would 
e.g. allow participants to walk around. The procedure of 
Access Grid sessions could also be changed, away from static 
meetings towards more dynamic collaborations.
Humanities scholars and performers have priorities and 
concerns that are often different from those of scientists and 
engineers (Nentwich 2003). With growing size of data resources 
the need arises to use recent methodological frameworks 
such as ontologies to increase the semantic interoperability of 
data. Building ontologies in the humanities is a challenge, which 
was the topic of the Theme workshop on ‘Ontologies and 
Semantic Interoperability for Humanities Data’. While semantic 
integration has been a hot topic in business and computing

research, there are few existing examples for ontologies in the 
Humanities, and they are generally quite limited, lacking the 
richness that full-blown ontologies promise. The workshop 
clearly pointed at problems mapping highly contextual data as 
in the humanities to highly formalized conceptualization and 
specifi cations of domains.
The activities within the UK’s arts and humanities e-Science 
community demonstrate the specifi c needs that have to be 
addressed to make e-Science work within these disciplines 
(Blanke and Dunn 2006). The early experimentation phase, 
which included the Theme events presented supra, delivered 
projects that were mostly trying out existing approaches in e-
Science. They demonstrated the need for a new methodology 
to meet the requirements of humanities data that is particularly 
fuzzy and inconsistent, as it is not automatically produced, but 
is the result of human effort. It is fragile and its presentation 
often diffi cult, as e.g. data in performing arts that only exists 
as an event.
The second phase of arts and humanities e-Science began 
in September 2007 with seven 3-4 years projects that are 
moving away from ad hoc experimentation towards a more 
systematic investigation of methodologies and technologies 
that could provide answers to grand challenges in arts and 
humanities research. This second phase could be put in a 
nutshell as e-science methodology-led innovative research in 
arts and humanity.
Next to performance, music research e.g. plays an important 
vanguard function at adopting e-Science methodologies, 
mostly because many music resources are already available 
in digital formats. At Goldsmiths, University of London, 
the project ‘Purcell Plus’ e.g. will build upon the successful 
collaboration ‘Online Musical Recognition and Searching 
(OMRAS)’ (http://www.omras.org/), which has just achieved 
a second phase of funding by the EPSRC. With OMRAS, it will 
be possible to effi ciently search large-scale distributed digital 
music collections for related passages, etc. The project uses 
grid technologies to index the very large distributed music 
resources. ‘Purcell Plus’ will make use of the latest explosion in 
digital data for music research. It uses Purcell’s autograph MS 
of ‘Fantazies and In Nomines for instrumental ensemble’ and 
will investigate the methodology problems for using toolkits 
like OMRAS for musicology research. ‘Purcell Plus’ will adopt 
the new technologies emerging from music information 
retrieval, without the demand to change completely proven 
to be good methodologies in musicology. The aim is to suggest 
that new technologies can help existing research and open 
new research domains in terms of the quantity of music and 
new quantitative methods of evaluation.
Building on the earlier investigations into the data deluge and 
how to deal with it, many of the second-phase projects look 
into the so-called ‘knowledge technologies’ that help with data 
and text mining as well as simulations in decision support for 
arts and humanities research. One example is the ‘Medieval 
Warfare on the Grid: The Case of Manzikert’ project in 
Birmingham, which will investigate the need for medieval states 
to sustain armies by organising and distributing resources. 
A grid-based framework shall virtually reenact the Battle of 
Manzikert in 1071, a key historic event in Byzantine history. 
Agent-based modelling technologies will attempt to fi nd out 
more about the reasons why the Byzantine army was so 
heavily defeated by the Seljurk Turks. Grid environments offer 
the chance to solve such complex human problems through 
distributed simultaneous computing.
In all the new projects, we can identify a clear trend towards 
investigating new methodologies for arts and humanities 
research, possible only because grid technologies offer 
unknown data and computational resources. We could see how 
e-Science in the arts and humanities has matured towards the 
development of concrete tools that systematically investigate 
the use of e-Science for research. Whether it is simulation of 
past battles or musicology using state-of-the-art information 
retrieval techniques, this research would have not been 
possible before the shift in methodology towards e-Science 
and e-Research.
