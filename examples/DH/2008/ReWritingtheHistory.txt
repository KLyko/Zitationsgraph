Introduction
On several occasions, Willard McCarty has argued that if 
humanities computing wants to be fully of the humanities, it 
needs to become historically self-aware (McCarty, 2004, p.161). 
Contrary to what the frequently repeated myth of humanities 
computing claims (de Tollenaere, 1976; Hockey, 1980, p. 15; 
1998, p. 521; 2000, p. 5; 2004, p. 4), humanities computing, like 
many other interdisciplinary experiments, has no very well-
known beginning.
A Common History
Several authors contradict each other when it comes to 
naming the founding father of digital humanities. At least four 
candidates compete with each other for that honour. Depending 
on whether one bases one’s research on ideas transmitted 
orally or in writing, on academic publications expressing and 
documenting these ideas, or on academic writings publishing 
results, Father Roberto Busa s.j., the Reverend John W. Ellison, 
Andrew D. Booth, and Warren Weaver are the competitors. 
This is not surprising since, when the use of automated digital 
techniques were considered to process data in the humanities, 
two lines of research were activated: Machine Translation (MT) 
and Lexical Text Analysis (LTA). Booth and Weaver belonged to 
the MT line of research and were not humanists by training, 
whereas Busa and Ellison were LTA scholars and philologists. 
As Antonio Zampolli pointed out, the fact that MT was 
promoted mainly in ‘hard science’ departments and LTA was 
mainly developed in humanities departments did not enhance 
frequent contacts between them. (Zampolli, 1989, p. 182) 
Although real scholarly collaboration was scarce, contacts 
certainly existed between the two on the administrative level. 
Since, as Booth (1967, p. VIII) observes, pure linguistic problems 
such as problems of linguistic chronology and disputed 
authorship, have profi ted from work on MT, the transition from 
MT to Computational Linguistics, dictated by the infamous US 
National Academy of Sciences ALPAC report (ALPAC, 1966), 
was a logical, though highly criticized, step. Moreover, the early 
writings on MT mention the essential use of concordances, 
frequency lists, and lemmatization – according to Zampolli 
(1989) typical products of LTA – in translation methods, which 
shows that both Computational Linguistics and Humanities 
Computing share a common history. This early history of both 
has never been addressed together, but it seems necessary for 
a good understanding of what it is that textual studies do with 
the computer.
The History of Humanities 
Computing
Researching and writing the history of humanities computing 
is no less but neither no more problematic than researching 
and writing the history of computing, technology in general, or 
the history of recent thought. Beverley Southgate considers 
the history of thought as an all-embracing subject matter 
which can include the history of philosophy, of science, of 
religious, political, economic, or aesthetic ideas, ‘and indeed 
the history of anything at all that has ever emerged from 
the human intellect.’ (Southgate, 2003, p. 243) Attached to 
the all-embracing nature of what she then calls ‘intellectual 
history/history of ideas’ is the defi ance from the constraints 
of disciplinary structures it creates with its practitioners. The 
history of humanities computing for instance must consider 
the history of the conventional schools of theory and practice 
of humanities disciplines, the general histories of computing 
and technology, the history of relevant fi elds in computing 
science and engineering, and the history of the application of 
computational techniques to the humanities.
The History of Recent Things
The history of recent things, however, poses some new and 
unique challenges for which, in Willard McCarty’s vision, 
a different conception of historiography is needed. As an 
illustration for his point, McCarty focuses on the different 
qualities of imagination that characterize the research and 
writing of the classical historian on the one hand and the 
historian of recent things on the other and situates them in 
a temporal and a spatial dimension respectively. A successful 
classical historian must manage the skill to move into the 
mental world of the long dead, whereas the historian of 
the recent past, like the anthropologist, must master the 
movement away ‘from the mental world we share with our 
subjects while remaining engaged with their work’ (McCarty, 
2004, p. 163). In a rash moment, this double awareness of 
the historian of the recent is fair game to triumphalism, the 
historian’s worst fi end. The temptation to search for historical 
and quantitative, rather than qualitative, ‘evidence’ to prove 
the importance of their own fi eld or discipline is innate in 
somewhat ambitious insiders attempting at writing the history 
of their own academic fi eld. Also since, as Alun Munslow has 
reiterated, it is historians rather than the past that generates 
(writes, composes?) history (Munslow, 1999), McCarty’s 
astute but non-exhaustive catalogue of the new and unique 
challenges presents itself as a warning for the historiographer 
of the new, and I endorse this list fully: ‘volume, variety, and 
complexity of the evidence, and diffi culty of access to it; biases 
and partisanship of living informants; unreliability of memory; 
distortions from the historian’s personal engagement with his 
or her informants—the ‘Heisenberg effect’, as it is popularly 
known; the ‘presentism’ of science and its perceived need for 
legitimation through an offi cial, triumphalist account; and so 
on.’ (McCarty, 2004, p. 163)

All history is inevitably a history for, and can never be 
ideologically neutral, as Beverly Southgate has recently 
emphasized in a review of Marc Ferro’s The Use and Abuse of 
History, or, How the Past is Taught. (Southgate, 2005) Therefore 
the question can never be ‘Comment on raconte l’histoire aux 
enfants à travers le monde entier’ as the original title of Ferro’s 
book reads. Greg Dening would say that writing history is a 
performance in which historians should be ‘focused on the 
theatre of what they do’. (Dening, 1996, p. 30) According to 
McCarty, the different conception of historiography, could profi t 
from acknowledging ethnographic theory and ethnography as 
a contributory discipline since it entails a poetic of ‘dilatation 
beyond the textable past and beyond the ‘scientifi c’ reduction 
of evidence in a correct and singular account.’ (McCarty, 2004, 
p. 174)
Prolegomena
The current lack of theoretical framework that can defi ne and 
study the history of humanities computing echoes what Michael 
Mahoney wrote with respect to the history of computing: ‘The 
major problem is that we have lots of answers but very few 
questions, lots of stories but no history, lots of things to do 
but no sense of how to do them or in what order. Simply put, 
we don’t yet know what the history of computing is really 
about.’ (Mahoney, 1993)
Three possible statements can be deducted from this 
observation:
• We don’t know what history is about;
• We don’t know what humanities computing is about;
• We don’t know what the history of humanities computing 
is about.
This paper aims at addressing these three basic questions 
by sketching out prolegomena to the history of humanities 
computing.
