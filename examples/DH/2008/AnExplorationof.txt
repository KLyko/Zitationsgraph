Introduction
This proposal reports on a research project exploring the 
nature of research teams in the Digital Humanities community. 
It is a start to understanding the type of supports and research 
preparation that individuals within the fi eld require to 
successfully collaborate within research teams.
Context
Traditionally, research contributions in the humanities fi eld 
have been felt to be, and documented to be, predominantly 
solo efforts by academics involving little direct collaboration 
with others, a model reinforced through doctoral studies 
and beyond (See, for example, Cuneo, 2003; Newell & Swan, 
2000). However, Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities is 
an exception to this. Given that the nature of research work 
involves computers and a variety of skills and expertise, Digital 
Humanities researchers are working collaboratively within 
their institutions and with others nationally and internationallly 
to undertake the research. This research typically involves the 
need to coordinate efforts between academics, undergraduate 
and graduate students, research assistants, computer 
programmers, librarians, and other individuals as well as the 
need to coordinate fi nancial and other resources. Despite this, 
there has been little formal research on team development 
within this community.
That said, efforts toward understanding the organizational 
context in which Digital Humanites research is situated is 
beginning in earnest. Two large-scale survey projects (Siemens 
et al., 2002; Toms et al., 2004) have highlighted issues of 
collaboration, among other topics, and Warwick (2004) found 
that the organizational context has had an impact on the manner 
in which Digital Humanities/Humanities Computing centres 
developed in the United States and England. Other studies 
are underway as well. In addition, McCarty (2005b) explores 
the ways that computers have opened the opportunities for 
collaboration within the humanities and has explored the 
associated challenges of collaboration and team research within 
the HUMANIST listserve (2005a). Finally, through efforts such 
as the University of Victoria’s Digital Humanities/Humanities 
Computing Summer Institute and other similar ventures, the 
community is working to develop its collaborative capacity 
through workshops in topics like community-specifi c project 
management skills, which also includes discussion of team 
development and support.
This study draws upon these efforts as it explores and 
documents the nature of research teams within the Digital 
Humanities community to the end of identifying exemplary 
work patterns and larger models of research collaboration 
that have the potential to strengthen this positive aspect of 
the community even further.
Methods
This project uses a qualitative research approach with in-
depth interviews with members of various multi-disciplinary, 
multi-location project teams in Canada, the United States, and 
the United Kingdom. The interview questions focus on the 
participants’ defi nition of teams; their experiences working in 
teams; and the types of supports and research preparation 
required to ensure effective and effi cient research results. The 
results will include a description of the community’s work 
patterns and relationships and the identifi cation of supports 
and research preparation required to sustain research teams 
(as per Marshall & Rossman, 1999; McCracken, 1988).
Preliminary Findings
At the time of writing this proposal, fi nal data analysis is being 
completed, but clear patterns are emerging and, after fi nal 
analysis, these will form the basis of my presentation.
The individuals interviewed currently are and have been a part 
of a diverse set of team research projects, in terms of research 
objective, team membership size, budget, and geographical 
dispersion, both within their own institution, nationally, and 
internationally. The roles they play are varied and include 
research assistant, researcher, computer programmer, and lead 
investigator. There are several commonalities among these 
individuals in terms of their skill development in team research 
and their defi nition of research teams and communities.
When fi nal data analysis is complete, a series of exemplary 
patterns and models of research collaboration will be 
identifi ed and outlined. These patterns and models will include 
the identifi cation of supports and research preparation which 
can sustain research teams in the present and into the future.
The benefi ts to the Digital Humanities community will be 
several. First, the study contributes to an explicit description 
of the community’s work patterns and relationships. Second, it 
also builds on previous efforts to understand the organizational 
context in which Digital Humanities/Humanities Computing 
centres operate in order to place focus on the role of the 
individual and teams in research success. Finally, it identifi es 
possible supports and research preparation to aid the further 
development of successful research teams.
