Introduction
Recent research at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities 
at King’s College London has focussed on the role and place 
of the digital humanities in the academic curriculum of Higher 
Education (see Jessop:2005, Jessop:forthcoming). This work 
is based on the experience of both our undergraduate and 
postgraduate programmes focusing particularly on the way in 
which students are encouraged to integrate the content of 
a variety of digital humanities courses and apply it to their 
own research project. In the case of the undergraduates this is 
developed in conjunction with their home department. These 
courses are designed to train not just the new generation of 
young scholars in our discipline but also the majority who will 
gain employment in a variety of professions in industry and 
commerce.
Our students come from a range of disciplines and backgrounds 
within the humanities and what is highlighted in each case is 
the necessity to ensure that their projects meet the scholarly 
criteria of their home disciplines and the interdisciplinary 
aspects of humanities computing. This emphasises the need for 
training the students in collaborative method and refl ective 
practice; the need to build a community of learning which will 
lead to a community of practice. This paper discusses recent 
research and initiatives within distance learning, focussing on 
how these can be repurposed for campus-based courses, and 
is illustrated by the fi ndings of their use in a digital humanities 
course.
Context
There have been a number of initiatives that are pertinent 
to this topic. The published report on the accomplishments 
of the Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities convened 
in 2005 at the University of Virginia (http://www.iath.virginia.
edu/dtsummit/ ) identifi ed areas where innovative change was 
taking place that could lead to what they referred to as “a new 
stage in humanistic scholarship”. The style of collaboration 
enabled by digital learning community tools is identifi ed as one 
such area. This has been further reinforced at the National 
Endowment of the Humanities hosted Summit Meeting of 
Digital Humanities Centers and Funders held in April 2007 at 
the University of Maryland.

On the summit wiki among the areas of research priorities 
and funder priorities John Unsworth lists: 
• Collaborative work
• Teaching and learning 
• Collaboration among scholars
(https://apps.lis.uiuc.edu/wiki/display/DHC/Areas+of+researc
h+priorities%2C+funder+priorities ) 
Building communities of learning and developing strategies 
for collaborative working has been the subject of much study 
within the distance learning community (Anderson:2004, 
Brown:2006, Perry and Edwards:2005, Swan:2002, et al) and 
here it is argued that this also needs to be a consideration 
for campus-based academic programmes. The growing trend 
among undergraduate programmes of a movement away from 
set courses to the introduction of modular and credit systems 
means that students no longer follow a single programme of 
study. Their time is fragmented between their chosen course 
options and they often only come together with their peers 
for ‘core courses’. Thus in the last two decades study has 
become more of an individual rather than community-based 
activity. This trend needs to be compensated for by teaching 
collaborative skills, the very same skills that are at the heart of 
the majority of digital humanities research projects.
The ‘Community of Inquiry’ model (developed by Garrison, 
Anderson and Archer:2000 and 2004) draws out the basic 
elements which overlap to form the educational experience 
of the distance learner: social, cognitive, and teaching 
presence. This model is used as a framework to analyse the 
effectiveness of asynchronous discussion methodologies 
(which encourage refl ective practice), with particular regard 
for cognitive presence (where students construct meaning 
through communication with their peers, which is particularly 
important in the development of critical thinking), when used 
in campus-based courses.  
Building Networked Communities for 
Collaborative and Refl ective Teaching 
and Learning  
The highly collaborative nature of modern research practice 
makes it clear that future humanities scholars need to be trained 
in the collaborative process and to understand the importance 
of critical refl ection (Jessop:2005, Jessop:forthcoming). This 
emphasis on collaborative practice represents a shift in the 
academic culture of humanities away from the popular funding 
model of a single researcher towards one of team working 
where no single person has complete control or ownership. 
This is closer to models in operation in the sciences where 
progress is often based on team efforts and reports frequently 
have many authors; we may need to develop protocols that 
borrow some aspects of science research practice. The results 
of the author’s limited research into the effectiveness of the 
collaborative process in medical research practice are also to 
be included in this study.
To develop an environment that fosters collaboration and 
refl ection students should be actively encouraged to engage 
with each other both inside and outside of the classroom. 
With social software (MySpace, Facebook, LiveJournal, inter 
alia) students are already building networked communities, 
and the blog and wiki have provided educators with simple, 
readily available tools to build learning communities. The wiki 
can be deployed as an experiential and formative learning 
environment outside of the classroom with students able 
to create their own content, comment on each others, and 
share resources using tools like del.icio.us and MyIntute. The 
blog supports this with a less formal refl ective space which 
belongs to the students themselves rather than their course. 
The asynchronous nature of these media gives students the 
opportunity to refl ect on their classmates’ contribution in the 
processes of creating their own (Swan:2000) and so instil the 
practice of critical refl ection. Further, with simple applications 
such as MyYahoo and iGoogle students can draw all their 
varied networks together along with course and departmental 
webpages thus giving a single interface or ‘Personal Learning 
Portal’ (PLP) through which to access and manage their online 
resources.    
In their PLP students create a web interface for their own 
digital environment that includes: 
• Content management where they integrate both personal 
and academic interests 
• A networking system for connection with others 
• Collaborative and individual workspace 
• Communications setup 
• A series of syndicated and distributed feeds 
This model is based on a presentation given by Terry Anderson 
at the Centre for Distance Education, University of London in 
March 2007:

htm). In this Anderson discusses how the Personal Learning 
Environment (PLE), such as that used at Athabasca, is an 
improvement on the popular Virtual Learning Environment 
(VLE). That argument is developed here with stress upon the 
further advantages of the PLP introduced earlier.   
What is notable is that this model represents an approach 
rather than a specifi c application and is portable and not

dependant on a single department or even institution. This 
ensures sustainability as it allows and encourages students to 
take the tools and skills from one area and apply them in others 
(arguably the basis of humanities computing, see McCarty 
and Short:2002). At the same time it puts the emphasis for 
the responsibility for managing their own learning and web 
resources on the students. 
In this approach learners are encouraged to interact and 
collaborate in a way that does not occur when static webpages 
are viewed with a traditional browser. The pages on a wiki and 
the student’s PLP are dynamic and mutable as they can be 
edited by the user through their web browser. Learners gain 
the ability to enrich the material and, unlike a print publication 
where those annotations are only for personal use, make 
these available for others. Such exchanges of ideas are central 
to the processes of building communities of learning and it is 
in this way that knowledge grows as we are able to push the 
boundaries of scholarship. The model that is developing here is 
one in which the student moves from being a reader of other 
peoples’ material to active engagement with that material; a 
transition from being a ‘reader’ to being an ‘interpreter’.   
Conclusion 
Education is an academic, individual, and a social experience 
that requires a sustainable community of learning. The tools 
and experiences developed in the distance learning fi eld can 
be re-purposed for the ‘analogue’ students. The suggested 
model based on the student’s PLP is grounded in collaborative 
practice, uses asynchronous discussion to develop refl ective 
practice and ensure cognitive presence; it is sustainable and 
portable.  Putting this in the wider context, it is by building 
a community of learners that we will instil the cooperative, 
collaborative, and refl ective skills needed for a community of 
humanities scholars; skills that are equally in demand outside 
of the academy. The tools have already been subject to limited 
trials in the digital humanities programmes at King’s College 
London but the current academic year will see a more extensive 
application of them across our teaching. The fi nal version this 
paper will report on the results of the experiences of both 
teachers and learners of this model applied to a humanities 
computing course. The work contributes to the pedagogy of 
the digital humanities in the academic curricula both within 
the teaching of humanities computing and the development 
of tools for collaborative research and on-line learning 
communities.
