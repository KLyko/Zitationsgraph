Introduction
The Dictionary of Words in the Wild [1] is an experiment 
in social textuality and the perceptual dynamics of reading. 
The Dictionary is a social image site where contributors can 
upload pictures of words taken “in the wild” and tag them so 
they are organized alphabetically as an online visual dictionary. 
Currently the Dictionary has 2227 images of 3198 unique 
words and 24 contributor accounts. The images uploaded 
and tagged are of text, usually single words or phrases, that 
appear in the everyday environment. Images uploaded include 
pictures of signs, body tatoos, garbage, posters, graffi ti, labels, 
church displays, gravestones, plastic bags, clothing, art, labels, 
and other sights. The site is structured with an application 
programming interface to encourage unanticipated uses.
 In this paper we will, 
• Give a tour through the online social site and its API,
• Discuss current scholarship on public textuality and the  
perceptual dynamics of reading,
• Refl ect on the Dictionary in these contexts, and
• Conclude with speculations on its possible contributions 
to our understanding of textuality and reading.
Outline of the Dictionary
 The following is a narrative of the demonstration part of the 
presentation.  
 The Dictionary was developed with Ruby on Rails by Andrew 
MacDonald with support from the TAPoR project under the 
direction of Geoffrey Rockwell. Users can get a free account 
in order to start uploading images. (We discovered once the 
project was visible for a few months that spambots were 
automatically creating accounts so we have introduced a 
CAPTCHAlike graphical challenge-response feature to weed 
out false accounts.)

When you upload a picture you are given the opportunity 
to crop it and are prompted to provide a list of words that 
appear in the text. You can also provide a brief description or 
discussion of the word image.
Once uploaded the image is fi led in a database and the interface 
allows you to access the images in different ways:
• You can click on a letter and browse images with words 
starting with that letter. An image with “On” and “Off” will 
be fi led twice, though at present the label is the fi rst word 
tagged.
• You can search for a word and see the images that have 
been  tagged with that word.
• You can type in a phrase and get a sequence of images.
• You can see what comments have been left by others on 
your images and respond to them.
The API allows the user to create other processes or text 
toys that can query the dictionary and get back an XML fi le 
with the URLs for word images like:
<phrase>
  <word href=”href_for_image”>Word</word>
  <word>Word_with_no_image</word>
</phrase>
One of the goals of the project is to support mashups that use 
the dictionary for new projects. This is where the Dictionary 
is different than other such projects, many of which use Flickr 
to pull images of letters or words.
Theoretical Discussion
The Dictionary is an exploratory project designed to 
encourage the gathering of images of words in the wild and 
to provoke thinking about our encounters with these words. 
It did not start with an articulated theory of text that it set 
out to illustrate, nor in the contributors’ experience does 
the actual collecting of words tend to be governed by this or 
that theory. Rather, in its simplicity, the Dictionary encourages 
participants to document public textuality as they encounter 
and perceive it.
At least in the initial phase of the project, the designers have 
imposed no rules or guidelines for the collecting, editing and 
tagging of words. Although it is clear that certain requirements 
for entering words into the Dictionary would make subsequent 
research questions easier to pursue, the designers prefer not 
to impose them so as to discover what in fact participants fi nd 
to be interesting and practical to record. Because recording of 
words is voluntary and would seem inevitably to be limited to 
a few individuals, the time and effort required must be kept to 
a minimum in order to have a collection suffi ciently large to 
allow the research potential of the Dictionary to emerge.
The Dictionary is meant to provoke refl ection on the actual 
verbal environment in its totality, on the moment-by-moment 
encounter with individual words and phrases where one fi nds 
them and on the experience of reading them as each reading 
unfolds.
Collecting of verbal images for the Dictionary presents 
collectors with a way of defamiliarizing familiar environments. 
Conventional techniques for framing a photograph and digital 
tools for cropping it give them limited but surprisingly powerful 
means of recording defamiliarized sights. Additional means are 
provided by a commentary feature, but the amount of time 
required to compose this commentary tends to discourage 
much of it. Theoretical refl ection on the encounter with words 
in the wild would seem to require participation in the project 
to be adequate to the data. For this reason collecting is not a 
task to be done separately from theorizing. Whatever theory 
is to emerge will come from participant observation.
In some cases, we have found, what appears interesting to 
record is relatively static, requiring little compositional care or 
subsequent cropping. In many cases, however, the experience 
of reading is a dynamic event, as when part of a verbal message, 
not necessarily fi rst in normal reading order, is perceived fi rst, 
then submerged into the overall syntax of its verbal and/or 
visual environment. In other cases, the experience may include 
a specifi c detail of the environment in which the text of interest 
is embedded but not be informed signifi cantly by other details. 
Occasionally one has suffi cient time to frame a photograph to 
capture the experience adequately, but most often photographs 
must be taken quickly, as when unwelcome attention would be 
drawn to the act of photography or the  situation otherwise 
advises stealth (an inscription on a t-shirt, for example). The 
Dictionary, one might say, is a record of psycholinguistic events 
as much or more than simply of environmental data.
In more theoretical terms, is the project aims to study how 
language acts as a semiotic system materially placed in the real 
word. In order to interpret this multidimensional, “semiotic” 
role of language, our analysis focuses on how dictionary users 
perceive different signs and attribute meanings to words by 
referring to these signs. We will argue that through this kind 
of visual dictionary contributors can interact and play with 
language by using visual artifacts (photos, images, graffi ti etc) 
to express and defi ne the meanings of words. We have strong 
theoretical reasons for regarding text as co-created by the 
reader in interaction with the verbal signs of the document 
being read. The Dictionary gives the reader of words in the 
wild a means of implementing the act of reading as co-creative, 
but with a signifi cant difference from those acts that have 
previously been the focus of theoretical work. The collector 
of wild words, like the reader of literature, is obviously not so 
much a viewer as a producer of meaning, but unlike the literary 
reader, the collector is operating in a textual fi eld whose real-
world context is highly unlikely ever to be otherwise recorded. 
It so obviously goes without saying that it also goes by and 
vanishes without ever being studied.

The title of the project suggests a distinction between text in 
two different places: the kind at home and the kind in the wild. 
But the collector’s gaze rapidly suggests that the distinction 
is only in part one of place. Text at home can also be ‘wild’ 
if it can be defamiliarized, e.g. the title of a book on its spine 
taken in poor light conditions inside a house. The wildness of 
words, is then ‘in the eye of the beholder’, though the domestic 
environment is usually so well regulated that opportunities 
for perceiving wildness are far more limited than in relatively 
undomesticated environments. Thus such opportunities 
tend to occur far less frequently in well-kept or wealthy 
neighbourhoods than in poorly kept ones, where rubbish is 
frequently encountered and advertising of all kinds is evident. 
This suggests ironically that poorer neighbourhoods are in 
respect of the sheer amount of reading more rather than less 
literate. But the correlation between wealth and verbosity is 
not so straightforward. Airport lounges, for example, are rich 
in examples of wild words. What would seem to matter in this 
correlation is the acquisitive desire of the population: those 
who have tend not to read for more.
Such theorizing, however, is clearly at a quite preliminary 
stage. The project calls for a more systematic ethnography 
of textuality and its everyday occurence. Insofar as it can 
be conceptualized, the long-term goal of the project can be 
put as a question: would it be possible to develop a panoptic 
topology of the appearance of the legible in everyday life, if 
even just for one person?
Similar Work
The Dictionary is one of a number of projects that use the 
internet to share images of textuality. For example, Typography 
Kicks Ass: Flickr Bold Italic [2] is Flash toy that displays messages 
left by people using letters from Flickr. The London Evening 
Standard Headline Generator [3] from thesurrealist.co.uk 
generates headlines from a Flickr set of images of headlines. 
IllegalSigns.ca [4] tracks illegal billboards in Toronto and has 
a Clickable Illegal Signs Map [5] that uses Google Maps. On 
Flickr one can fi nd sets like Its Only Words [6] of images of 
texts.
What all these projects have in common is the photographic 
gaze that captures words or phrases in a context whether 
for aesthetic purposes or advocacy purposes. The Dictionary 
is no different, it is meant to provoke refl ection on the wild 
context of text as it is encountered on the street.
 The Future
The success of the project lies in how the participants 
push the simple assumptions encoded in the structure. The 
project would have failed had no one contributed, but with 
contributions come exceptions to every design choice. The 
types of text contributors want to collect and formally tag has 
led to the specifi cation of a series of improvements that are 
being implemented with the support of TAPoR and SSHRC. 
The paper will conclude with some images and the future 
directions they have provoked:
• We need to parse phrases so that we remove punctuation. 
For example, “faith,” won’t fi nd the image for “faith”.
• We need to allow implicit words to be entered with 
parentheses where the word doesn’t appear, but is 
implicit. An example would be http://tapor1-dev.mcmaster.
ca/~dictwordwild/show/694 which is fi led under “Average” 
even though the word doesn’t appear.
• We need to allow short phrasal verbs and compounds to 
be  entered with quotation marks so they are fi led as one 
item.  An example would be “come up” or “happy days”.
• We need to allow images of longer passages to identifi ed 
as  “Sentences in the Sticks”, “Phrases in the Fields” or 
“Paragraphs in the Pastures”. These would not be fi led 
under individual words, but the full text could be searched.
• We need to allow people to control capitalization so that, 
for example, “ER” (which stands for “Emergency Room”) is 
not rendered as “Er”.
• We need to let people add tags that are not words so 
images can be sorted according to categories like “Graffi ti” 
or “Billboard”.
