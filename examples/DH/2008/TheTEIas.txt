The TEI as Luminol: Forensic 
Philology in a Digital Age

A signifi cant number of digital editions have been published 
in recent years, and many of these serve as exemplars for 
those of us working within the digital editing community. A 
glance at Electronic Text Editing, for example, published in 2006, 
indicates that such projects address a wide berth of editorial 
problems, ranging from transcriptional practices to document 
management to authenticity. And they offer a wealth of 
information to editors working on various types of digital 
editions.
In this paper, I consider an editorial problem that has yet to be 
resolved. My discussion centers on the diffi culties that arise 
in editing a single, albeit somewhat unusual, Icelandic saga: 
Hafgeirs saga Flateyings. This saga is preserved in an unsigned, 
eighteenth-century manuscript, Additamenta 6, folio (Add. 6, 
fol.). Today housed in the collection of the Arni Magnusson 
Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjavík, Iceland, the 
manuscript was originally held as part of the Arnamagnæan 
Collection in Copenhagen, Denmark. According to the fl yleaf: 
“Saga af Hafgeyre fl ateying udskreven af en Membran der 
kommen er fra Island 1774 in 4to exarata Seculo xij” (Hafgeirs 
saga Flayetings was copied from a twelfth-century manuscript 
written in quarto, which came [to Copenhagen] from Iceland in 
1774).
While such a manuscript might appear unremarkable, as a 
number of paper manuscripts were copied during the late 
eighteenth century in Copenhagen, then the capital of Iceland 
and the seat of Icelandic manuscript transmission during this 
period, only twelve Old Norse/Old Icelandic manuscripts of 
those catalogued in the Copenhagen collections are dated to 
the twelfth century, while a mere eighteen are dated to 1200 
(Kalund 512). The dating on the fl yleaf is therefore unusual, and 
as it turns out, suspect as well, since no catalog entry exists 
to record the existence of the alleged source manuscript. 
Moreover, according to Jorgensen, the motif sequences found in 
Hafgeirs saga bear a striking resemblance to those found in the 
well-known mythical-heroic saga Hálfdanars saga Brönufóstra 
(157). And in a fascinating argument based primarily on this 
fact, Jorgensen argues that Add. 6, fol. is a forgery, claiming that 
Þorlákur Magnússon Ísfi ord, an Icelandic student studying and 
working in Copenhagen during the 1780s, composed and sold 
Hafgeirs saga as a copy of an authentic medieval Icelandic saga 
(163).
In spite of its questionable origin, Hafgeirs saga stands as a 
remnant of Iceland’s literary, linguistic, and textual history, and 
Add. 6, fol. can therefore be viewed as an important cultural 
artefact. As the editor of the Hafgeirs saga manuscript, my 
aim is to provide a ‘reliable’ (see “Guidelines for Editors of 
Scholarly Editions” Section 1.1) electronic edition of the text 
and the manuscript. But the question, at least until recently, 
was how? What is the best way to represent such a text? 
Encoding the work according to a markup standard such 
as the TEI Guidelines is surely a starting point, but doing so 
doesn’t solve one of the primary concerns: How to represent 
the manuscript reliably (which presents a complex editorial 
problem of its own), while at the same time illuminating the 
textual and linguistic ‘artefacts’ that may offer readers insight 
into the saga’s origin?
At the 2007 Digital Humanities Summer Institute, Matthew 
Driscoll gave a talk entitled “Everything But the Smell: Toward 
a More Artefactual Digital Philology.” The talk provided a brief 
history of the shift toward ‘new’ philology, and, importantly, 
underscored the signifi cance of the material or ‘artefactual’ 
aspect of new philology, which views manuscripts as physical 
objects and thus as cultural artefacts which offer insight into 
the “process to which they are witness” (“Everything But the 
Smell: Toward a More Artefactual Digital Philology”). The TEI, 
Driscoll pointed out, offers support for artefactual philology, and 
the descriptive framework of the P5 Guidelines, which defi nes 
Extensible Markup Language (XML) as the underlying encoding 
language, is ideal for this kind of work. Moreover, as Driscoll 
suggests, there is “no limit to the information one can add to 
a text - apart, that is, from the limits of our own imagination” 
(“Electronic Textual Editing: Levels of Transcription”). To be 
sure, this paper does not lapse into what McCarty refers to 
as the ‘complete encoding fallacy’ or the ‘mimetic fallacy’ (see 
Dahlström 24), but it does agree with Driscoll in arguing that 
P5-conformant editions, which can offer a signifi cant layering 
of data and metadata, have the potential to move the reader 
beyond the aesthetics of sensory experience.
By defi nition, artefactual philology portends a kind of 
‘evidentiary’ approach, one that can frame textual features, 
including linguistic and non-linguistic features (such as lacunae) 
for example, as kinds of evidence. Evidence of what? That is 
in the hands of the editors and the readers, but conceivably: 
linguistic development, the transmission process, literary merit, 
and so on. And when an evidentiary approach to philology is 
defi ned within a ‘generative’ approach to a scholarly edition 
(see Vanhoutte’s “Generating” 164), a new direction in 
electronic editing becomes possible.
This paper explores this new direction. It shows how the 
Hafgeirs saga edition employs such a framework to address 
the problem of describing linguistic and non-linguistic artefacts, 
which are precisely the kinds of evidence that can bear witness 
to the composition date and transmission process. And it 
demonstrates how the display decisions result in an interactive 
and dynamic experience for the edition’s readers.
For example, in addition to elements defi ned within existing 
modules of the TEI, the edition’s schema defi nes four new 
elements1. Drawn from the perspectives of historical and 
socio- linguistics, these elements are intended to aid readers 
in evaluating the saga’s composition date. Given the ‘logic

of abundance’ (see Flanders 135), encoding the metadata 
described in the new elements beside the descriptive data 
described by pre-defi ned elements (such as <del> for example) 
can be accomplished without sacrifi cing the role of the text as 
a literary and cultural artefact. Because the transformation of 
the source XML has been designed to display interactively the 
various encodings of the text2, readers can view or suppress the 
various descriptions and generate their own novel versions of 
the text. Readers can display archaisms, for instance, and assess 
whether they are “affectation[s] of spurious age” (Einar 39) or 
features consistent with the textual transmission process, and 
they can view borrowings, for instance, and assess whether 
they preclude a medieval origin or are to be expected in a 
text ostensibly copied by a scribe living in Copenhagen during 
the eighteenth century. Or they can suppress these features 
and view the normalized transcription, the semi-diplomatic 
transcription, emendations, editorial comments, or any 
combination of these.
Ultimately, this paper synthesizes aspects of text editing, 
philology, and linguistics to explore a new direction in digital 
editing. In doing so, it frames P5 XML as a kind of luminol that, 
when transformed, can be used to illuminate new types of 
evidence: linguistic and philological data. And the goal is identical 
to that of a crime-scene investigator’s: Not necessarily to solve 
the case, but to preserve and to present the evidence.
Notes
[1] The <borrowing> element describes a non-native word which 
has been adopted into the language. Distinct from the <foreign> 
element, a borrowing may have the following attributes: @sourcelang 
(source language), @borrowdate (date of borrowing), @borrowtype 
(type of borrowing; e.g. calque, loanword). The <modernism> 
element describes a word, phrase, usage, or peculiarity of style 
which represents an innovative or distinctively modern feature. The 
<neologism> element describes a word or phrase which is new to 
the language or one which has been recently coined. The <archaism> 
element describes an archaic morphological, phonological, or syntactic 
feature or an archaic word, phrase, expression, etc.

with Garrick Bodine, most recently presented at TEI@20 on 
November 1, 2007: “From XML to XSL, jQuery, and the Display of
