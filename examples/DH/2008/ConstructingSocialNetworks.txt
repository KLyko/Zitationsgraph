Introduction  
The Associational Culture in Ireland (ACI) project at NUI 
Maynooth explores the culture of Irish associational life from 
1750 to 1940, not merely from the point of view of who, what, 
where and when, but also to examine the ‘hidden culture’ of 
social networking that operated behind many clubs and societies 
throughout the period. Recently commissioned government 
research on civic engagement and active citizenship in Ireland has 
highlighted the paucity of data available for establishing ‘trends 
in volunteering, civic participation, voting and social contact in 
Ireland’ (Taskforce on Active Citizenship, Background Working 
Paper, 2007, p. 2). The same research has also confi rmed the 
importance in Ireland of informal social networking compared 
to many other economically developed countries (Report of 
the Taskforce on Active Citizenship, 2007). The objective of the 
ACI project is to provide a resource to enable scholars of Irish 
social and political life to reconstruct and highlight the role 
that the wider informal community information fi eld played in 
the public sphere in Ireland from the mid-eighteenth century. 
The project will also provide long-term quantitative digital data 
on associational culture in Ireland which is compatible with 
sophisticated statistical analysis, thereby enabling researchers 
to overcome one of the hindrances of modern-day purpose 
based social surveys: the short timeframe of data currently 
available.
Associational Culture and Social 
Networking  
All historians are aware of the importance of social networks 
that underpin the foundations of social and political life in the 
modern world (Clark, 2000; Putnam, 2000). However, given the 
often-transient nature of much of these networks, they can be 
quite diffi cult to reconstruct. 
One way to examine social networks is to trace them through 
the structures of a developing associational culture where the 
cultivation of social exclusivity and overlapping membership 
patterns provide insights into the wider organisation of civil 
society at local, regional and national levels. To this end, the 
ACI project mines a wide range of historical sources to piece 
together as comprehensive a view as possible of the various 
voluntary formal associations that existed in Ireland during the 
period c.1750-c.1940. 
The fi rst phase of the project concentrated on collecting 
data on Irish associational culture and social networking 
in the period 1750-1820; the current phase centres on the 
period 1820-1880 and the third phase will focus on the 
years between 1880 and 1940. The research results so far 
testify to the vibrancy of associational activity in Ireland and 
already patterns in social networking are becoming apparent 
in different parts of the country. The results so far indicate 
that particular forms of associational culture were popular in 
different parts of the country from the mid-eighteenth century, 
which in turn produced their own particular social networking 
systems. In many respects these patterns were maintained into 
the nineteenth century with similar continuities in patterns 
of sociability even though these continuities were sometimes 
expressed through different organisations, e.g. the ubiquitous 
Volunteering movement of the later eighteenth century 
gave way to local Yeomanry units in the beginning of the 
nineteenth century. Associational culture among the urban 
middling strata also appeared to increase somewhat moving 
into the nineteenth century with the increasing appearance of 
charitable and temperance societies in different parts of the 
country. 
Software Development  
Given the vast range of data available in the sources and 
the multiplicity of question types posed by the fi ndings, the 
organisation and dissemination of the research was one of 
the main priorities for the project. The desire to present a 
quantitative as well as qualitative profi le of Irish associational 
culture, which can be expanded upon by future research, 
presented particular diffi culties in terms of the production 
of the project’s fi ndings. A multi-skilled, partnership approach 
was adopted, fusing historical and computer science expertise 
to digitally represent the data recovered from the sources 
and expose the resultant social networking patterns through 
the construction of an appropriate online database for the 
project. Encompassing over seventy individual data fi elds for 
each association, the online ACI database is fully searchable by 
organisation and by individual – the later feature in particular 
allowing social patterns behind Irish associational culture to 
be traced over the course of two centuries. 
 Bradley (2005) points out XML is well suited to document 
oriented project materials (such as written text), whereas 
relational database implementations are better suited to data 
oriented project materials. Furthermore, he indicates that 
projects may often use both, given that textual materials often 
contain data materials that are more suited to relational models. 
He argues that even if one begins with a text, the materials 
may be data-orientated and better served by a relational 
model where certain characteristics, for example, linkages 
between data objects and powerful querying are more easily 
expressed using SQL (Structured Query Language) than XML

searching facilities, for example, XPATH or XQUERY. It was 
necessary, for our project to use a relational model to encode 
data orientated materials, even though data were derived 
from newspaper articles which are typically more suited to 
encoding in XML. Our relational objects are densely linked, 
and it is often necessary to build SQL queries incorporating 
multiple joins across many database tables. 
 The database contains over 100 individual database tables 
related to associations, members, sources, relationships, 
associate members, locations, etc. Authenticated data entry 
and access is available using online forms. Test, rollback and 
moderation facilities are available for different classes of user. 
Research queries may be formulated using a specifi cally designed 
English language-type formal grammar called Associational 
Culture Query Language (ACQL), which is parsed by the 
software system to extract and present information from the 
database – parsing involves evaluating ACQL and converting it 
into appropriately constructed SQL suitable for querying the 
database. Users may construct ACQL manually or they may 
use an online query builder (see Figure 1). 
 The software engineering process began with all partners 
involved in a collaborative process concentrating on the 
construction of a Specifi cation of Requirements (SR) 
document which essentially formed the contract between 
the ACI historians and software engineers – this key 
document was used to derive all phases of the software 
development process, for example, System Analysis, System 
Design Specifi cations, Software Specifi cations, and Testing and 
Maintenance.  These phases were implemented using a rapid 
prototyping model, where successive passes through a design-
development-testing cycle provided new prototypes which 
could be evaluated against the SR document. As is typical 
of such development projects, there was some requirement 
drift, but the rapid prototyping approach ensured insignifi cant 
divergence between prototypes and expectations outlined in 
the SR document. 
 In order to produce the SR document, the ACI historians 
composed a series of research questions, which were used 
to extract the information categories necessary for the 
construction of social networks. During the collaborative 
process, these research questions and sources were used to 
identify and model the relationships between the associations 
and individuals in the sources. A key requirement was that 
ACI historians wanted to be able to answer specifi c research 
questions related to social networking, for example, “Are there 
any illegal women’s associations/clubs active in Ireland after 
1832?” It was necessary to revise these research questions 
during the Analysis phase, however, as it became apparent that 
the historians did not expect a yes/no answer to this question, 
but rather a list of the associations and clubs, if they existed. 
Most research questions went through a revision process 
where the cardinality or result context was explicit, i.e. “List 
the illegal women’s associations active in Ireland after 1832”. 
This research question could be reformulated in ACQL as 
follows: 
LIST THE BODIES (NAME) ( 
WHERE THE GENDER IS “Female” AND  
WHERE THE STATUS IS “Illegal” AND  
WHERE THE FOUNDING DATE  
IS GREATER THAN 1st OF January 1832 
) 
 The parsing software then converts this 
ACQL query into the following SQL:
SELECT BodyName.bodyName  
FROM  Body, BodyGender, 
BodyName, BodyStatus  
WHERE  (Body.idBody = BodyName.
Body_idBody) AND  
  (Body.idBody = BodyGender.
Body_idBody AND 
   BodyGender.gender =’Female’  AND   
 (Body.idBody = BodyStatus.
Body_idBody AND  
  BodyStatus.typeOfStatus =’Illegal’  AND 
  (Body.foundingDate > ‘1832-01-1’) 
 ) 
); 
 This query  is then  executed  by  the  Relational Database 
Management System  (RDBMS) and the results are returned 
to the environment for presentation to the user. 
 We examined over one hundred questions of this type 
ensuring that our relational model provided appropriate 
answers. We developed ACQL to map research questions 
into SQL queries, thereby removing the requirement for the 
user to have knowledge of the database, table joins, or even 
SQL. Researchers need not have an intimate knowledge of the 
relationship between the database tables and their associated 
fi elds to perform searches. Another advantage of this approach 
is that the underlying database structure could change and the 
users would not have to change the format of their queries 
implemented in ACQL.  
Ongoing and Future Developments  
The success of this project depends on the research 
community using and contributing to the information 
contained in the online database. We are heartened, however, 
by the reports of  Warwick et al (2007)  who have  shown 
that  when information aggregation  sites  have  user-friendly 
interfaces,  contain  quality  peer-reviewed information, and fi t 
research needs, the research community scholars are more 
likely adopt the digital resource. We believe that ACQL is a 
crucial component in making this system usable by professional 
historians interested in social networking. In particular, as the 
volume of data within the database expands in digital format, 
the potential for developing further social analysis tools such 
as sociograms will be initiated. All in all, the ACI database, 
by providing quantitative and qualitative data on specifi c

associations, regions, and groups of individuals, comparable 
with international data sources, will greatly aid historical and 
social science researchers to establish Irish trends in civic 
participation, social inclusion, marginalisation and grassroots 
organising in modern Ireland.
