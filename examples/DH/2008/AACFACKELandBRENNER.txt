In this paper two highly innovative digital editions will be 
presented. The digital editions of the historical literary journals 
“Die Fackel” (published by Karl Kraus in Vienna from 1899 
to 1936) and “Der Brenner” (published by Ludwig Ficker in 
Innsbruck from 1910 to 1954) have been developed within the 
corpus research framework of the “AAC - Austrian Academy 
Corpus” at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in collaboration 
with other researchers and programmers in the AAC from 
Vienna together with the graphic designer Anne Burdick from 
Los Angeles. For the creation of these scholarly digital editions 
the AAC edition philosophy and principles have been made 
use of whereby new corpus research methods have been 
applied for questions of computational philology and textual 
studies in a digital environment. The examples of these online 
editions will give insights into the potentials and the benefi ts 
of making corpus research methods and techniques available 
for scholarly research into language and literature.
Introduction
The “AAC - Austrian Academy Corpus” is a corpus research 
unit at the Austrian Academy of Sciences concerned with 
establishing and exploring large electronic text corpora and 
with conducting scholarly research in the fi eld of corpora and 
digital text collections and editions. The texts integrated into 
the AAC are predominantly German language texts of historical 
and cultural signifi cance from the last 150 years. The AAC has 
collected thousands of texts from various authors, representing 
many different text types from all over the German speaking 
world. Among the sources, which systematically cover various 
domains, genres and types, are newspapers, literary journals, 
novels, dramas, poems, advertisements, essays on various 
subjects, travel literature, cookbooks, pamphlets, political 
speeches as well as a variety of scientifi c, legal, and religious 
texts, to name just a few forms. The AAC provides resources 
for investigations into the linguistic and textual properties of 
these texts and into their historical and cultural qualities. More 
than 350 million running words of text have been scanned,

digitized, integrated and annotated. The selection of texts is 
made according to the AAC’s principles of text selection that 
are determined by specifi c research interests as well as by 
systematic historical, empirical and typological parameters. 
The annotation schemes of the AAC, based upon XML 
related standards, have in the phase of corpus build-up been 
concerned with the application of basic structural mark-up 
and selective thematic annotations. In the phase of application 
development specifi c thematic annotations are being made 
exploring questions of linguistic and textual scholarly research 
as well as experimental and exploratory mark-up. Journals are 
regarded as interesting sources for corpus research because 
they comprise a great variety of text types over a long period 
of time. Therefore, model digital editions of literary journals 
have been developed: The AAC-FACKEL was published on 1 
January 2007 and BRENNER ONLINE followed in October 
2007. The basic elements and features of our approach 
of corpus research in the fi eld of textual studies will  be 
demonstrated in this paper.

The digital edition of the journal “Die Fackel” (“The Torch”), 
published and almost entirely written by the satirist and 
language critic Karl Kraus in Vienna from 1899 until 1936, 
offers free online access to 37 volumes, 415 issues, 922 
numbers, comprising more than 22.500 pages and 6 million 
tokens. It contains a fully searchable database of the journal 
with various indexes, search tools and navigation aids in an 
innovative and functional graphic design interface, where 
all pages of the original are available as digital texts and as 
facsimile images. The work of Karl Kraus in its many forms, 
of which the journal is the core, can be regarded as one of 
the most important, contributions to world literature. It is a 
source for the history of the time, for its language and its moral 
transgressions. Karl Kraus covers in a typical and idiosyncratic 
style in thousands of texts the themes of journalism and 
war, of politics and corruption, of literature and lying. His 
infl uential journal comprises a great variety of essays, notes, 
commentaries, aphorisms and poems. The electronic text, 
also used for the compilation of a text-dictionary of idioms 
(“Wörterbuch der Redensarten zu der von Karl Kraus 1899 
bis 1936 herausgegebenen Zeitschrift ‘Die Fackel’”), has been 
corrected and enriched by the AAC with information. The 
digital edition allows new ways of philological research and 
analysis and offers new perspectives for literary studies.
BRENNER ONLINE

The literary journal “Der Brenner” was published between 
1910 and 1954 in Innsbruck by Ludwig Ficker. The text of 18 
volumes, 104 issues, which is a small segment of the AAC’s 
overall holdings, is 2 million tokens of corrected and annotated 
text, provided with additional information. “Die Fackel” had set 
an example for Ludwig Ficker and his own publication. Contrary 
to the more widely read satirical journal of Karl Kraus, the 
more quiet “Der Brenner” deals primarily with themes of 
religion, nature, literature and culture. The philosopher Ludwig 
Wittgenstein was affi liated with the group and participated in 
the debates launched by the journal. Among its contributors 
is the expressionist poet Georg Trakl, the writer Carl Dallago, 
the translator and cultural critic Theodor Haecker, translator 
of Søren Kierkegaard and Cardinal Newman into German, 
the moralist philosopher Ferdinand Ebner and many others. 
The journal covers a variety of subjects and is an important 
voice of Austrian culture in the pre and post second world 
war periods. The digital edition has been made by the AAC 
in collaboration with the Brenner-Archive of the University

of Innsbruck. Both institutions have committed themselves 
to establish a valuable digital resource for the study of this 
literary journal. 
Conclusion
The philological and technological principles of digital editions 
within the AAC are determined by the conviction that the 
methods of corpus research will enable us to produce valuable 
resources for scholars. The AAC has developed such model 
editions to meet these aims. These editions provide well 
structured and well designed access to the sources. All pages 
are accessible as electronic text and as facsimile images of 
the original. Various indexes and search facilities are provided 
so that word forms, personal names, foreign text passages, 
illustrations and other resources can be searched for in 
various ways. The search mechanisms for personal names have 
been implemented in the interface for BRENNER ONLINE 
and will be done for “Die Fackel”. The interface is designed to 
be easily accessible also to less experienced users of corpora. 
Multi-word queries are possible. The search engine supports 
left and right truncation. The interface of the AAC-FACKEL 
provides also search mechanisms for linguistic searches, allows 
to perform lemma queries and offers experimental features. 
Instead of searching for particular word forms, queries for all 
the word forms of a particular lemma are possible. The same 
goes for the POS annotation. The web-sites of both editions 
are entirely based on XML and cognate technologies. On the 
character level use of Unicode has been made throughout. All 
of the content displayed in the digital edition is dynamically 
created from XML data. Output is produced through means of 
XSLT style sheets. This holds for the text section, the contents 
overview and the result lists. We have adopted this approach 
to ensure the viability of our data for as long a period as 
possible. Both digital editions have been optimized for use 
with recent browser versions. One of the basic requirements 
is that the browser should be able to handle XML-Dom and 
the local system should be furnished with a Unicode font 
capable of displaying the necessary characters. The interface 
has synchronized fi ve individual frames within one single 
window, which can be alternatively expanded and closed as 
required. The “Paratext”-section situated within the fi rst frame 
provides background information and essays. The “Index”-
section gives access to a variety of indexes, databases and 
full-text search mechanisms. The results are displayed in the 
adjacent section. The “Contents”-section has been developed, 
to show the reader the whole range of the journal ready to 
be explored and provides access to the whole run of issues 
in chronological order. The “Text”-section has a complex 
and powerful navigational bar so that the reader can easily 
navigate and read within the journals either in text-mode or 
in image-mode from page to page, from text to text, from 
issue to issue and with the help of hyperlinks. These digital 
editions will function as models for similar applications. The 
AAC’s scholarly editions of “Der Brenner” and “Die Fackel” 
will contribute to the development of digital resources for 
research into language and literature.
