The purpose of this presentation is to demonstrate the 
research opportunities that the TTC-ATENEA system offers 
to specialists in Art Theory. Principally, we will focus on 
those functionalities that are able to assist specialists in the 
interpretation of the theoretical discourses, a complex task 
due to the ambiguity and inaccuracy that distinguish this type 
of artistic terminology.
Introduction
The TTC-ATENEA system is currently being developed under 
my supervision in a Project supported by the Ministerio de 
Educación y Ciencia of Spain called Desarrollo de un tesauro 
terminológico conceptual (TTC) de los discursos teórico-artísticos 
españoles de la Edad Moderna, complementado con un corpus 
textual informatizado (ATENEA) (HUM05-00539). It is an 
interdisciplinary project integrated by the following institutions: 
University of Málaga (Spain), University of de Santiago de 
Compostela (Spain), University of Valencia (Spain), European 
University of Madrid (Spain), the Getty Research Institute (Los 
Angeles, EE.UU.), the University of Chicago (EE.UU.) and the 
Centro de Documentación de Bienes Patrimoniales of Chile. 
Also, it maintains a fruitful collaboration with the Department 
of Computational Languages and Sciences of the University 
of Málaga, specifi cally with the Project called ISWeb: Una 
Infraestructura Básica para el Desarrollo de La Web Semántica y su 
Aplicación a la Mediación Conceptual (TIN2005-09098-C05-01).
This system can be defi ned as a virtual net made up of two 
complementary components: an electronic text database 
(ATENEA), and the terminological conceptual thesaurus 
(TTC). The TTC is a knowledge tool for art specialists that 
consists of a compilation of described, classifi ed and linked 
terms and concepts. The textual database consists of important 
art-historical texts (16th -18th centuries), encoded in XML-
TEI (1), that supply the terms and concepts recorded in the 
thesaurus (2).
We want to remark the signifi cant contribution of ATENEA 
database to the fi eld of the virtual and digital libraries in Spain. 
Despite the fact that the building of digital and virtual libraries 
is an important area of development (3), ATENEA represents 
one of the fi rst textual databases about specialized subject 
matter –with exception of the digital libraries on literary texts- 
(4). It is a very different situation from other contexts, where 
we fi nd relevant specialized electronic textual collections. It

is the case, for example, of the digital libraries about Italian 
artistic texts developed and managed by Signum (Scuola 
Normale Superiore di Pisa) (5); or the collections included in 
the ARTFL Project (University of Chicago) (6).
Providing Solutios to the Ambiguity of 
Art-theoretical Terminology
The confi guration of the ATENEA-TTC system was determined 
by the main purpose of the project itself--that is, to provide 
a satisfactory answer to the terminological/conceptual 
problems that encumber the task of conducting research in 
art theory, due to the high degree of semantic density of the 
terminology contained in historical documents. In this respect, 
it is important to point out that the objective of the Project is 
not only to distinguish the terminological polysemy, that is, the 
different concepts that a term denotes (i.e., disegno as product, 
disegno as abstract concept, disegno as formal component of 
the paintings…), but also the different interpretations that the 
same concept assumes in discourses belonging to different 
authors. For instances, the concept disegno, understood as an 
abstract concept, has not the same interpretation in Zuccaro´s 
treatise than in Vasari´s one, what implies that the term disegno 
does not mean exactly the same in such texts. Indeed, this is 
one of the more problematic aspects of textual interpretation, 
since the same term assumes different semantic nuances in 
each text or treatise, increasing, in that way, the possibilities 
for ambiguity and error.
In connection with this question, the eminent Professor 
Fernando Marías (7) has suggested the development of a 
“cronogeografía” of the art-theoretical concepts and terms. In 
his words, the so-called “cronogeografía” should be a precise 
means of control of the emergence and use of the theoretical 
vocabulary as well as of the ideas behind this. We consider that 
the methodology proposed by this Project could be an answer 
to Professor Marías´ suggestion.
It is clear that this approach requires, fi rstly, a comparative 
conceptual analysis among the artistic texts stored in ATENEA 
in order to identify the different interpretations of each 
concept and, as a result, the semantic variations assumed by 
every term. To make visible in the thesaurus these semantic-
conceptual distinctions, we have proceeded to tag concepts 
and terms by mean of parenthetical qualifi ers related to authors, 
which have been specifi cally developed to this end. These 
qualifi ers specify the author who has used or defi ned them. 
Thus, the TTC records the conceptual-semantic variations 
among concepts and terms used by different authors, and also 
shows them graphically and visually. For example, the following 
representation generated by the system (fi gure 1):
Fig. 1. Uses and interpretations of vagueza in 
the Spanish art –theory (17th century).
reveals us, at a glance, that vagueza has the same interpretation 
in Sigüenza and Santos´s discourses, but that this assumes 
other senses in Carducho and Martinez´s treatises.
This procedure implies other signifi cant feature of the 
ATENEA-TTC system: that terms and concepts are described 
in the TTC according to how they has been used or defi ned in 
each particular text. This last point deserves to be emphasized. 
Effectively, there are other projects that also link terms to online 
dictionary entries, in which the user fi nds general defi nitions 
of the terms. Nevertheless, in the TTC terms and concepts are 
defi ned in reference to the specifi c texts in where they have 
been located. So, clicking on the selected term or concept, the 
user gets information about how such term or concept has 
been specifi cally used and defi ned in a particular text or by a 
particular author.
In addition to that, the TTC-ATENEA system provides full 
interaction between the ATENEA corpus and the TTC. The 
system easily allows the defi nition of connections between a 
term or a concept in an XML-TEI marked text and the registry 
of the TTC. Thus, terms and concepts in the text are linked 
to all their relevant information, stored and structured in the 
TTC records. In the same way, the system allows to establish 
a connection between terms and concepts registered in the 
TTC and the different places where they appear in the XML-
TEI marked texts. As far as XML-TEI marked texts and TTC 
are stored in the same database, we can establish these links in 
a totally effective and effi cient way without having to access to 
different data repositories to retrieve and link this information. 
Consequently, one of the most important potentialities of 
the system as a research tool derives from the interactions 
that users are able to establish among the different types of 
information compiled in each repository.
Finally, future extensions of the TTC-ATENEA will study 
the possibility of use not only a thesaurus but a full fl edged 
OWL [7] ontology and its integration in the Khaos Semantic

Web platform [8] [9] [10] in order to achieve a formal explicit 
representation of the artistic epistemology contained in the 
texts.
Research Possibilities
The system allows users to retrieve the stored information 
from both terminological-conceptual and textual repositories. 
Nevertheless, as indicated above, the most important research 
possibilities derive from the interactions that users are able 
to establish between each repository. To illustrate this, we will 
give a brief example.
1. ATENEA Corpus as a starting point. Imagine that a 
specialist is interested in studying the meanings of the terms 
used by the Italian author F. Pacheco in his Spanish treatise 
(Diálogos de la Pintura, 1633). ATENEA Corpus enables the 
specialist to visualize the electronic transcription of the text, 
and explore it linguistically by means of different queries -
concordances, frequency lists, co-occurrences…- since the 
system has been implemented with its own textual analyzer. 
These functionalities do not constitute any novelty; all we 
know that. Consequently, the most relevant feature resides in 
the fact that the system allows user to browse directly from 
a term or concept located in a text to the TTC record where 
such term or concept is described according to its use in 
Carducho´s text (fi gure 2). 
Fig. 2. Connection between a concept in an XML-TEI marked 
text (ATENEA) and the TTC record, where it is described.
In this way, the specialist is able to identify the precise senses 
that the terms used by Carducho assume, and, therefore, 
analyze with more accuracy his theory about the painting.
Once the specialist has accessed to the TTC records, the 
system offers him other research possibilities given that 
the recorded information is linked to other sections of the 
TTC as well as to other texts stored in ATENEA. Thus, the 
specialist is able to go more deeply in his investigation and 
to get complementary information browsing through the site. 
The presentation will show some clarifying examples of these 
other possibilities.
2. TTC as a starting point. Imagine now that the specialist is 
interested in the use of a particular term. In this case, the most 
convenient is to search the term in the TTC. Made the query, 
the specialist retrieves the different concepts associated to 
the term, as in a conventional specialized dictionary. However, 
as the term is marked with the author-parenthetical qualifi ers, 
the specialist also fi nds out in which discourses the term has 
been identifi ed denoting each concept (see fi gure1). In fact, 
various hyperlinks enable him to go from the TTC record to 
the exact point of the texts -stored in ATENEA- where the 
term appears denoting such concepts (fi gure 3). 
Fig. 3. Connection between a concept registered in the TTC and 
the places where they appear in the XML-TEI marked texts.
Once in ATENEA Corpus, the specialist has the opportunity 
to use its functionalities in order to specify his investigation.
The presentation will show in full detail these possibilities of 
usage derived from this interactivity-based approach, and will 
include time for Q&A. We believe that the questions taken 
into consideration in our exposition will be of interest to 
other humanistic disciplines, since the diffi culties of textual 
interpretations due to the terminological ambiguity is a 
common place in the fi eld of the Humanities.
