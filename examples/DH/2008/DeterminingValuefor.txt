Tool development in the Digital Humanities has been the 
subject of numerous articles and conference presentations 
(Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), 2006; Bradley, 
2003; McCarty, 2005; McGann, 2005; Ramsay, 2003, 2005; 
Schreibman, Hanlon, Daugherty, Ross, 2007; Schreibman, Kumar, 
McDonald, 2003; Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities, 
2005; Unsworth, 2003). While the purpose and direction of 
tools and tool development for the Digital Humanities has 
been discussed and debated in those forums, the value of tool 
development itself has seen little discussion. This is in part 
because tools are developed to aid and abet scholarship – they 
are not necessarily considered scholarship themselves. That 
perception may be changing, though. The clearest example of 
such a shift in thinking came from the recent recommendations 
of the ACLS Commission on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities 
and Social Sciences, which called not only for “policies for 
tenure and promotion that recognize and reward digital 
scholarship and scholarly communication” but likewise stated 
that “recognition should be given not only to scholarship that 
uses the humanities and social science cyberinfrastructure but 
also to scholarship that contributes to its design, construction 
and growth.” On the other hand, the MLA Report on Evaluating 
Scholarship for Tenure and Promotion found that a majority of 
departments have little to no experience evaluating refereed 
articles and monographs in electronic format. The prospects 
for evaluating tool development as scholarship in those 
departments would appear dim. However, coupled with the 
more optimistic recommendations of the ACLS report, as well 
the MLA Report’s fi ndings that evaluation of work in digital 
form is gaining ground in some departments, the notion of tool 
development as a scholarly activity may not be far behind.
In 2005, scholars from the humanities as well as the social 
sciences and computer science met in Charlottesville, Virginia 
for a Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities. While the summit 
itself focused primarily on the use of digital resources and digital 
tools for scholarship, the Report on Summit Accomplishments 
that followed touched on development, concluding that “the 
development of tools for the interpretation of digital evidence 
is itself research in the arts and humanities.” 
The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the process of 
software or tool development itself can be considered the 
scholarly activity, and not solely a means to an end, i.e. a feature 
or interface for a content-based digital archive or repository. 
This paper will also deal with notions of value: both within the 
development community and as developers perceive how their 
home institutions and the community for which the software 
was developed value their work. 
The data for this paper will be drawn from two sources. The 
fi rst source is a survey carried out by the authors in 2007 on 
The Versioning Machine, the results of which were shared at 
a poster session at the 2007 Digital Humanities Conference. 
The results of this survey were intriguing, particularly in the 
area of the value of The Versioning Machine as a tool in which 
the vast majority of respondents found it valuable as a means 
to advance scholarship in spite of the fact that they themselves 
did not use it. As a result of feedback by the community to 
that poster session, the authors decided to conduct a focused 
survey on tool development as a scholarly activity. 
After taking advice from several prominent Digital Humanities 
tool developers, the survey has been completed and will be 
issued in December to gather information on how faculty, 
programmers, web developers, and others working in the 
Digital Humanities perceive the value and purpose of their 
software and digital tool development activities. This paper will 
report the fi ndings of a web-based survey that investigates 
how tools have been conceived, executed, received and used 
by the community. Additionally, the survey will investigate 
developers’ perceptions of how tool development is valued in 
the academic community, both as a contribution to scholarship 
in their particular fi elds, and in relation to requirements for 
tenure and promotion.
The authors will use these surveys to take up John Unsworth’s 
challenge, made at the 2007 Digital Humanities Centers Summit 
“to make our diffi culties, the shortcomings of our tools, 
the challenges we haven’t yet overcome, something that we 
actually talk about, analyze, and explicitly learn from.”  By 
examining not only how developers perceive their work, but 
how practitioners in the fi eld use and value their tools, we 
intend to illuminate the role of tool development in the Digital 
Humanities and in the larger world of academia.
