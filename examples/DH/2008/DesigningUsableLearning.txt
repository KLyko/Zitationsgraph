A fair amount of research suggests that video games can be 
effective tools for learning complex subject matter in specifi c 
domains (Cordova & Lepper, 1996; Ricci, Salas, & Cannon-
Bowers, 1996; Randel et al., 1992; Fiore et al., 2007; Garris & 
Ahlers et al., 2002). Although there has been much work in 
situating “serious gaming” (Sawyer, 2002) as a legitimate vehicle 
for learning in all types of disciplines, there is no central source 
for research on crafting and designing what is considered to 
be a usable game for the humanities. In this paper, we discuss 
research issues related to the design of “usable” humanities-
based video games and situate those research questions along 
fi ve interrelated dimensions.
We fi rst provide our defi nition of usability as used in this 
context. A usable humanities game is a game which is both 
functionally capable in terms of an interface and its human 
interactions as well as appropriately designed to support the 
types of learning objectives attached to its scenarios or levels. 
This defi nition is formed from the convergence of traditional 
interface usability and learning effectiveness. We support our 
delineation of research questions using theoretical work from 
scholars writing about gaming as well as applied examples 
from our own research and game development prototypes. 
Drawing from three years of experience building a variety 
of games, and literature culled from our various fi elds, we 
discuss some of the unique research questions that designing 
for the humanities pose for scholars and game designers. We 
separate these questions across fi ve dimensions, each with 
representative humanities learning questions:

1. Participation: how can we encourage diverse groups 
of students and researchers to interact together in virtual 
space? How can we design a space that is appealing and 
equitable to both genders and to a diverse range of 
demographic profi les?
2. Mechanics: how do you design algorithms that are 
applicable to the types of tasks commonly sought in 
humanities courses? For instance, how might one develop an 
algorithm to “score” morally relative gameplay decisions in 
an ethical dilemma?
3. Ontology: how is a player’s self-image challenged when 
shifting from a real to what Gee (2003) calls a projected 
identity, and how is this process changed through the use 
of varying perspectives such as fi rst-person or third-person 
perspective?
4. Hermeneutics: how do we probe the hidden layers that 
exist between game worlds, source content, and human 
computer interfaces? What “voices” are encouraged in 
virtual worlds, and what voices are repressed within this 
rhetorical space?
5. Culture: how are the cultural facets of primary source 
content mediated through the process of digitization?
To consider these dimensions, we craft a theoretical base 
formed from a wide range of researchers such as Gee (2003), 
Prensky (2001), Squire (2002), and Jenkins (2006a, 2006b). From 
Gee, we draw inspiration from his discussion of well-designed 
games and his exploration of the implicit learning occurring in 
several different genres of digital video games. Much of Gee’s 
work has involved applying insights from the cognitive sciences 
to traditional humanities domains such as literature in order 
to explore identity, problem solving skills, verbal and nonverbal 
learning, and the transfer of learned abilities from one task to 
another. Marc Prensky notes that musical learning games in 
the humanities have been used for hundreds of years -- Bach’s 
Well Tempered Clavier and The Art of the Fugue are his “learning 
games,” simple to complex musical exercises that build skill. 
Prensky’s work also informs our historical analysis as well 
as insights from the pioneers working in the fi eld of serious 
gaming for military applications.
Jenkins’ work in applying the interests of gaming fans as critical 
lenses provides insight for both formative guidelines and post-
task measures of “success” in learning game environments. 
These gaming discourse communities often form wildly active 
and infl uential fan groups, and these groups cultivate their 
own forms of expression and understanding through complex 
jargon, virtual initiations, and ritualistic rules and procedures 
in virtual interaction. Gaming environments and virtual worlds 
have also been shown to offer rich sources of material for 
investigating notions of gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural 
identity (Berman & Bruckman, 2001; Squire, 2002).
Building on the work of these scholars, others have extended 
these general notions of digital game based learning to account 
for specifi c curricula or learning objectives such as media 
project management for humanities computing (McDaniel et 
al., 2006). To build these humanities learning games, we have 
assembled an interdisciplinary team composed of faculty 
members from Digital Media, English, and Philosophy. Individuals 
from this group have worked in a variety of capacities, as script 
writers, artists, programmers, and producers. Undergraduate 
and graduate students, in both classroom and research lab 
roles, have worked and contributed to each of these games 
in varying capacities. Five different games have been produced 
through these collaborations:
1. Discover Babylon (Lucey-Roper, 2006), a game produced 
by the Federation of American Scientists, the Walters 
Art Museum in Baltimore, and UCLA’s Cuneiform Digital 
Library Initiative (CDLI). One of our team members 
developed the storyline for this game.
2. The Carol Mundy Underground Railroad game (Greenwood-
Ericksen et al., 2006) examines issues of African-American 
history and culture and leads a player on an adventure from 
a Southern plantation to safety in the North through the 
Underground Railroad’s system of safehouses. This was a 
“modded” game built atop Neverwinter Nights.
3. The Turkey Maiden (Underberg, forthcoming) is an 
educational computer game project based on a version 
of Cinderella collected by folklorist Ralph Steele Boggs 
in 1930s Ybor City, Florida. This variant of the Cinderella 
story, called “The Turkey Maiden” (from Kristin Congdon’s 
anthology Uncle Monday and Other Florida Tales, 2001) forms 
the narrative structure of the game, which has been further 
developed by integrating specifi c tasks that the heroine 
Rosa (“Cinderella”) must successfully complete to advance 
in the game that are based in lessons to be learned by the 
player about Florida history and culture.
4. Chaucer’s Medieval Virtual World Video Game is a virtual 
medieval world game based on Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. 
This tale emphasizes the battle between men’s perceived 
authority and women’s struggles for power. This game 
uses Chaucer’s narrative gap as a springboard for a virtual 
medieval quest. In addition to experiencing historical 
scenarios, the knight will disguise his identity and experience 
the world from various gender and social classes, the Three 
Estates of Clergy, Nobility, and Peasantry as well as the 
three feminine estates of virgin, widow, and wife.
5. The Medium is a prototype ethics game designed using 
the Torque game engine. This three year project was funded 
by the University of Central Florida’s Offi ce of Information 
Fluency and is in its earliest stages of design. The game pairs 
a time travel theme with a switchable fi rst and third person 
perspective and also includes an environmentalist subtext.
We will use brief examples culled from these games to

support our theoretical assertions and discuss ways in 
which usable humanities games can act as a springboard for 
bringing together subject matter experts, technologists, and 
learners. In their 2006 report on Cyberinfrastructure for 
the Humanities and Social Sciences, the American Council of 
Learned Societies writes the following in regards to digital 
networked technologies for the humanities: “A cyberstructure 
for humanities and social science must encourage interactions 
between the expert and the amateur, the creative artist and 
the scholar, the teacher and the student. It is not just the 
collection of data—digital or otherwise—that matters: at least 
as important is the activity that goes on around it, contributes 
to it, and eventually integrates with it” (14). Our goal is to 
foster this type of humanistic, communicative environment 
using new technologies for virtual worlds, usability testing, and 
game-based learning environments. We hope that the scholarly 
community working the fi eld of digital humanities can help 
us to explore and refi ne both theoretical models and applied 
technologies related to this goal.
