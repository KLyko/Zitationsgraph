The foundations of the linguistics of speech (i.e., language 
in use, what people actually say and write to and for each 
other), as distinguished from ?the linguistics of linguistic 
structure? that characterizes many modern academic ideas 
about language, are 1) the continuum of linguistic behavior, 2) 
extensive (really massive) variation in all features at all times, 3) 
importance of regional/social proximity to “shared” linguistic 
production, and 4) differential frequency as a key factor in 
linguistic production both in regional/social groups and in 
collocations in text corpora (all points easily and regularly 
established with empirical study using surveys and corpora, 
as shown in Kretzschmar Forthcoming a). Taken together, the 
basic elements of speech correspond to what has been called a 
?complex system? in sciences ranging from physics to ecology 
to economics. Order emerges from such systems by means of 
self-organization, but the order that arises from speech is not 
the same as what linguists study under the rubric of linguistic 
structure. This paper will explore the relationship between the 
results of computational analysis of language data with neural 
network algorithms, traditionally accepted dialect areas and 
groupings, and order as it emerges from speech interactions.
In both texts and regional/social groups, the frequency 
distribution of features (language variants per se or in proximal 
combinations such as collocations, colligations) occurs as the 
same curve: a ?power law? or asymptotic hyperbolic curve 
(in my publications, aka the ?A-curve?). Speakers perceive 
what is “normal” or “different” for regional/social groups and 
for text types according to the A-curve: the most frequent 
variants are perceived as “normal,” less frequent variants are 
perceived as “different,” and since particular variants are more 
or less frequent among different groups of people or types of 
discourse, the variants come to mark identity of the groups 
or types by means of these perceptions. Particular variants 
also become more or less frequent in historical terms, which 
accounts for what we call “linguistic change,” although of course 
any such “changes” are dependent on the populations or text 
types observed over time (Kretzschmar and Tamasi 2003). In 
both synchronic and diachronic study the notion of “scale” 
(how big are the groups we observe, from local to regional/
social to national) is necessary to manage our observations 
of frequency distributions. Finally, our perceptions of the 
whole range of “normal” variants (at any level of scale) create 
“observational artifacts.” That is, the notion of the existence 
of any language or dialect is actually an “observational artifact” 
that comes from our perceptions of the available variants (plus 
other information and attitudes), at one point in time and for 
a particular group of speakers, as mediated by the A-curve.

The notion “Standard,” as distinct from “normal,” represents 
institutional agreement about which variants to prefer, some 
less frequent than the “normal” variants for many groups of 
speakers, and this creates the appearance of parallel systems 
for “normal” and “Standard.”
The best contemporary model that accommodates such 
processing is connectionism, parallel processing according to 
what anthropologists call “schemas” (i.e., George Mandler’s 
notion of schemas as a processing mechanism, D’Andrade 1995: 
122-126, 144-145). Schemas are not composed of a particular 
set of characteristics to be recognized (an object), but instead 
of an array of slots for characteristics out of which a pattern is 
generated, and so schemas must include a process for deciding 
what to construct. One description of such a process is the 
serial symbolic processing model (D’Andrade 1995: 136-
138), in which a set of logical rules is applied in sequence to 
information available from the outside world in order to select 
a pattern. A refi nement of this model is the parallel distributed 
processing network, also called the connectionist network, or 
neural net (D’Andrade 1995: 138-141), which allows parallel 
operation by a larger set of logical rules. The logical rules 
are Boolean operators, whose operations can be observed, 
for example, in simulations that Kauffman (1996) has built 
based on networks of lightbulbs. Given a very large network 
of neurons that either fi re or not, depending upon external 
stimuli of different kinds, binary Boolean logic is appropriate 
to model “decisions” in the brain which arise from the on/off 
fi ring patterns. Kauffman’s simulations were created to model 
chemical and biological reactions which are similarly binary, 
either happening or not happening given their state (or pattern) 
of activation, as the system cycles through its possibilities. 
The comparison yields similar results: as D’Andrade reports 
(1995: 139-140), serial processing can be “’brittle’--if the input 
is altered very slightly or the task is changed somewhat, the 
whole program is likely to crash” (or as Kauffman might say, 
likely to enter a chaotic state cycle), while parallel processing 
appears to be much more fl exible given mixed or incomplete 
input or a disturbance to the system (or as Kauffman might 
say, it can achieve homeostatic order).
Computational modeling of neural networks appears, then, to be 
an excellent match for analysis of language data. Unfortunately, 
results to date have often been disappointing when applied 
to geographic language variation (Nerbonne and Heeringa 
2001, Kretzschmar 2006). Neural network analysis cannot be 
shown reliably to replicate traditional dialect patterns. Instead, 
self-organizational patterns yielded by neural net algorithms 
appear to respond only in a general way to assumed dialect 
areas, and often appear to be derived not from the data but 
from conditions of its acquisition such as “fi eld worker” effects 
(Kretzschmar Forthcoming b). However, this paper will show, 
using results from experiments with an implementation of 
a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm (Thill, Kretzschmar, 
Casas, and Yao Forthcoming), that application of the model from 
the linguistics of speech to computer neural network analysis 
of geographical language data can explain such anomalies. It 
is not the implementation of neural nets that is the problem, 
but instead lack of control over the scale of analysis, and of 
the non-linear distribution of the variants included in the 
analysis, that tends to cause the problems we observe. In the 
end, we still cannot validate traditional dialect areas from the 
data (because these areas were also derived without suffi cient 
control over the dynamics of the speech model), but we can 
begin to understand more clearly how the results of neural 
network analysis do reveal important information about the 
distribution of the data submitted to them.
