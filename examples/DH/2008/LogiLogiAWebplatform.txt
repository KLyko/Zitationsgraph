LogiLogi is a hypertext platform featuring a rating-system 
that tries to combine the virtues of good conversations 
and the written word. It is intended for all those ideas that 
you’re unable to turn into a full sized journal paper, but that 
you deem too interesting to leave to the winds. It’s central 
values are openness and quality of content, and to combine 
these values it models peer review and other valuable social 
processes surrounding academic writing (in line with Bruno 
Latour). Contrary to early websystems it does not make use 
of forumthreads (avoiding their many problems), but of tags 
and links that can also be added to articles by others than the 
original author. Regardless of our project, the web is still a very 
young medium, and bound to make a change for philosophy in 
the long run.
Introduction
The growth of the web has been rather invisible for philosophy 
so far, and while quite some philosophizing has been done 
about what the web could mean for the human condition, 
not much yet has been said about what it could mean for 
philosophy itself (ifb; Nel93; Lev97, mainly). An exception is 
some early enthusiasm for newsgroups and forums in the 
nineties, but that quickly died out when it became apparent 
that those were not suitable at all for in-depth philosophical 
conversations. The web as a medium however is more than 
these two examples of early web-systems, and in the meantime 
it has further matured with what some call Web 2.0, or social 
software (sites like MySpace, Del.icio.us and Wikipedia). Time 
for a second look. . .
LogiLogi Manta (Log), the new version of LogiLogi, is 
a webplatform that hopes to — be it informally and 
experimentally—allow philosophers and people who are 
interested in philosophy to use the possibilities that the 
internet has in stock for them too. It was started with a 
very small grant from the department of Philosophy of the 
Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. It is Free Software, has been 
under development for almost 2 years, and will be online by 
June 2008. 
In the following paragraph we will explain what LogiLogi is, 
and in section 3 LogiLogi and the web as a new medium are 
embedded in the philosophical tradition. Optionally section 2 
can be read only after you have become interested by reading 
3.
A Webplatform for Philosophers
LogiLogi becomes an easy to use hypertext platform, also 
featuring a rating- and review-system which is a bit comparable 
to that found in journals. It tries to fi nd the middle-road 
between the written word and a good conversation, and it’s 
central values are openness and quality of content. 
It makes commenting on texts, and more generally the linking 
of texts very easy. Most notably it also allows other people 
than the original author of an article to add outgoing links 
behind words, but it does not allow them to change the text 
itself, so the author’s intellectual responsibility is guarded. Also 
important is that all conversations on the platform run via links 
(comparable to footnotes), not via forum-threads, avoiding 
their associated problems like fragmentation and shallowing 
of the discussion.
To maximize the advantages of hypertext, texts are kept short 
within LogiLogi, at maximum one to a few pages. They can be 
informal and experimental and they can be improved later on, 
in either of two ways: The text of the original document can be 
changed (earlier versions are then archived). Or secondly, links 
can be added inside the text, possibly only when some terms 
or concepts appear to be ambiguous, when questions arise, or 
when the text appears to arouse enough interest to make it 
worth of further elaboration. 
Links in LogiLogi can refer to documents, to versions, and 
— by default — to tags (words that function as categories or 
concepts). Articles can be tagged with one or more of these 
tags. Multiple articles can have the same tag, and when a link is 
made to a tag or to a collection of tags, multiple articles can be 
in the set referred to. From this set the article with the highest 
rating is shown to the user.
In essence one can rate the articles of others by giving 
them a grade. The average of these grades forms the rating 
of the article. But this average is a weighted average. Voting-
powers can vary. If an authors contributions are rated well, 
he receives more voting-power. Authors can thus gain ’status’ 
and ’infl uence’ through their work. This makes LogiLogi a peer-
reviewed meritocracy, quite comparable to what we, according 
to Bruno Latours philosophy of science, encounter in the 
various structures surrounding journals (Lat87). Most notably 
this quality control by peer review, and it’s accompanying social 
encouragement, was missing from earlier web-systems.
But the comparison goes further, and in a similar fashion to 
how new peergroups can emerge around new journals, in 
LogiLogi too new peergroups can be created by duplicating 
the just described rating-system. Contributions can be rated 
from the viewpoints of different peergroups, and therefore an 
article can have multiple ratings, authors won’t have the same 
voting-power within each peergroup, and visitors can pick 
which peergroup to use as their fi lter. Thus except meritocratic, 
LogiLogi is also open to a diversity of schools and paradigms

in the sense of early Thomas Kuhn (Kuh96), especially as here 
creating new peergroups—unlike for journals—does not bring 
startup-costs.
Plato, Free Software and 
Postmodernism
The web is a relatively new medium, and new media are 
usually interpreted wrongly — in terms of old media. This 
is has been called the horseless carriage syndrome (McL01); 
according to which a car is a carriage without a horse, fi lm 
records theater-plays, and—most recently—the web enables 
the downloading of journals. Even Plato was not exempt of 
this. In Phaedrus he stated that true philosophy is only possible 
verbally, and that writing was just an aid to memory. Regardless 
of this ironically enough his ’memory aid’ unleashed a long 
philosophical tradition (dM05). New media take their time. 
And we should not forget that the web is still very young 
(1991). Also the web is especially relevant for philosophy in 
that it combines conversation and writing; the two classical 
media of philosophy. 
And where previous mass-media like TV and radio were not 
suitable for philosophy, this was because they were one to 
many, and thus favored the factory model of culture (Ado91). The 
web on the other hand is many to many, and thereby enables 
something called peer to peer production (Ben06). An early 
example of this is Free Software: without much coordination 
tenthousands of volunteers have created software of the 
highest quality, like Linux and Firefox. Eric Raymond (Ray99) 
described this as a move from the cathedral- to the bazaar-
model of software development. The cathedral-model has a 
single architect who is responsible for the grand design, while 
in the bazaar-model it evolves from collective contributions. 
This bazaar-model is not unique for the web. It shares much 
with the academic tradition. The move from the book to 
the journal can be compared with a move in the direction 
of a bazaar-model. Other similarities are decentralized 
operation and peer-review. The only new thing of the Free 
Software example was it’s use of the web which — through 
it’s shorter turnaround times — is very suitable for peer to 
peer production. 
Another development that LogiLogi follows closely is one 
within philosophy itself: Jean-Franois Lyotard in his La Condition 
Postmoderne proclaimed the end of great stories (Lyo79). 
Instead he saw a diversity of small stories, each competing 
with others in their own domains. Also Derrida spoke of 
the materiality of texts, where texts and intertextuality gave 
meaning instead of ’pure’ ideas (Ber79; Nor87). The web in 
this sense is a radicalisation of postmodernism, allowing for 
even more and easier intertextuality. 
And instead of trying to undo the proliferation of paradigms, as 
some logic-advocates tried, and still try, we think the breakdown 
of language—as in further segmentation—is here to stay, and 
even a good thing, because it reduces complexity in the sense 
of Niklas Luhmann (Blo97). Take human intelligence as fi xed 
and you see that specialized (or ’curved’ as in curved space) 
language allows for a more precise analysis. LogiLogi thus is 
explicitly modeled to allow for fi ne-grained specialization, and 
for a careful defi nition and discussion of terms in context.
Conclusion
To reiterate; LogiLogi will offer an easy to use hypertext-
environment, and thanks to it’s rating system a combination of 
quality and openness will be achieved: everyone can contribute, 
and even start new peergroups, but within peergroups quality 
is the determining factor. LogiLogi thus combines the informal, 
incremental and interactive qualities of good conversations, 
with conservation over time and space, as we traditionally know 
from the written word. LogiLogi is still very experimental.
Nevertheless what we can be sure about is that the web, as 
a medium that has proven to be very suitable for peer to peer 
production and that promises increased inter-textuality and 
differentiation of language, is bound to make a change for 
philosophy in the long run; with or without LogiLogi.
