Previous stylometric studies (Rybicki 2006, 2006a, 2007) of 
patterns in multivariate diagrams of correlation matrices 
derived from relative frequencies of most frequent words in 
character idiolects (Burrows 1987) in a number of originals 
and translations (respectively, Sienkiewicz’s trilogy of historical 
romances and its two English translations; Rybicki’s Polish 
translations of novels by John le Carré; and the three English 
versions of Hamlet, Q1, Q2, F, and its translations into nine 
different languages) have all yielded interesting similarities in 
the layout of data points in the above-mentioned diagrams for 
corresponding originals and translations. The repetitiveness of 
the observed phenomenon in many such pairs immediately 
raised some questions as to its causes – the more so as the 
most-frequent-word lists for any original and its translations, 
consisting primarily of functions words, modals, pronouns, 
prepositions and articles (if any in a given language) contains 
few direct counterparts in any two languages.
The primary suspect for a possible bias was the difference 
in size between the parts of individual characters, since that 
particular feature invariably remains proportionally similar 
between original and translation (Rybicki 2000). The import 
of this element remained unnoticed in many other studies 
employing Burrows’s time-proven method (later developed, 
evaluated and applied by a number of scholars, including Hoover 
2002) since they were either conducted on equal samples or, 
more importantly, although some did address the problem of 
translation, they never dealt with so many translations at a 
time as did e.g. the Hamlet study (Rybicki 2007).
The emerging suspicion was that since the sizes of the 
characters studied do not vary signifi cantly between the twelve 
versions of Hamlet, this proportion might heavily infl uence 
the multivariate graphs produced – the more so as, in most 
cases, the most talkative characters occupied central positions 
in the graphs, while the lesser parts were usually limited to 
the peripheries. This (together with similar effects observed 
in earlier studies) had to lead to a reassessment of the results. 
Also, since most studies were conducted in traditional male-
dominated writing, resulting in female characters speaking 
little in proportion even to their importance in the plot, 
these peripheries usually included separate groups of women; 
while this was often seen as the authors’ ability to stylistically 
differentiate “male” and “female” idiom, the size bias could 
distort even this quite possible effect.
A number of tests was then performed on character 
idiolects and narrative fragments of various sizes and various 
confi gurations of characters from selected English novels 
and plays – ranging from Ruth and David Copperfi eld; from 
Conan Doyle to Poe; narration in Jane Austen, or plays by Ben 
Jonson and Samuel Beckett – to investigate how the impact 
of size distorts the image of stylistic differences presented in 
multivariate diagrams.
One possible source of the bias is the way relative frequencies 
of individual words are calculated. Being a simple ratio of 
word frequency to size of sample, it may be as unreliable 
as another very similar formula, the type-to-token ratio (or, 
indeed, one as complex as Yule’s K), has been found to be 
unreliable as a measure of vocabulary richness in samples 
of different size (Tweedie & Baayen 1997). Also, due to the 
nature of multivariate analyses used (both Factor Analysis and 
Multimensional Scaling), it is not surprising that the less stable 
statistics of the less talkative characters would have their data 
points pushed to the peripheries of the graph. Finally, since the 
list of the most frequent words used in the analysis is most 
heavily infl uenced by the longest parts in any text, this might 
also be the reason for the “centralising” bias visible in data 
points for such characters.
It should be stressed that the above reservations do not, 
in any way, invalidate the entire method; indeed, results for 
samples of comparative size remain reliable and unbiased. Also, 
it should not be forgotten that size of a character’s part is in 
itself an individuating feature of that character.
