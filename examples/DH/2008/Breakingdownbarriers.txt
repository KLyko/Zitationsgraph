Breaking down barriers: 
the integration of research 
data, notes and referencing 
in a Web 2.0 academic 
framework

 In this paper I argue that the arbitrary distinction between 
bibliographic data and research data – which we see in the 
existence of specialised library catalogues and bibliographic 
systems on the one hand, and a multitude of ad hoc notes, 
digitized sources, research databases and repositories on the 
other – is a hangover from a simpler past, in which publication 
and bibliographic referencing was a well-defi ned and separate 
part of the research cycle.
Today published material takes many different forms, from 
books to multimedia, digital artworks and performances. 
Research data results from collection and encoding of 
information in museums, archives, libraries and fi eldwork, as 
well as output from analysis and interpretation. As new forms 
of digital publication appear, the boundary between published 
material and research data blurs. Given the right enabling 
structures (eg. peer review) and tools (eg. collaborative 
editing), a simple digitized dataset can become as valuable as 
any formal publication through the accretion of scholarship. 
When someone publishes their academic musings in a personal 
research blog, is it analogous to written notes on their desk 
(or desktop) or is it grey literature or vanity publishing?
The drawing of a distinction between bibliographic references 
and other forms of research data, and the storing of these data in 
distinct systems, hinders construction of the linkages between 
information which lie at the core of Humanities research. Why 
on earth would we want to keep our bibliographic references 
separate from our notes and developing ideas, or from data 
we might collect from published or unpublished sources? Yet 
standalone desktop silos (such as EndNote for references, 
Word for notes and MSAccess for data) actively discourage 
the linking of these forms of information.
Bespoke or ad hoc databases admirably (or less than admirably) 
fulfi ll the particular needs of researchers, but fail to connect 
with the wider world. These databases are often desktop-
based and inaccessible to anyone but the user of their host 
computer, other than through sharing of copies (with all the 
attendant problems of redundancy, maintenance of currency 
and merging of changes). When accessible they often lack multi-
user capabilities and/or are locked down to modifi cation by a 
small group of users because of the diffi culties of monitoring 
and rolling back erroneous or hostile changes. Even when

accessible to the public, they are generally accessible through 
a web interface which allows human access but not machine 
access, and cannot therefore be linked programmatically with 
other data to create an integrated system for analyzing larger 
problems.
For eResearch in the Humanities to advance, all the digital 
information we use – bibliographic references, personal notes, 
digitized sources, databases of research objects etc. – need 
to exist in a single, integrated environment rather than in 
separate incompatible systems. This does not of course mean 
that the system need be monolithic – mashups, portals and 
Virtual Research Environments all offer distributed alternatives, 
dependant on exposure of resources through feed and web 
services. The ‘silo’ approach to data is also breaking down 
with the stunning success of web-based social software 
such as the Wikipedia encyclopaedia or Del.icio.us social 
bookmarking systems. These systems demonstrate that – with 
the right level of control and peer review – it is possible to 
build substantial and highly usable databases without the costs 
normally associated with such resources, by harnessing the 
collaborative enthusiasm of large numbers of people for data 
collection and through data mining of collective behaviour.
To illustrate the potential of an integrated Web 2.0 approach 
to heterogeneous information, I will discuss Heurist 
(HeuristScholar.org) – an academic social bookmarking 
application which we have developed, which provides rich 
information handling in a single integrated web application 
– and demonstrate the way in which it has provided a new 
approach to building signifi cant repositories of historical data.
Heurist handles more than 60 types of digital entity (easily 
extensible), ranging from bibliographic references and internet 
bookmarks, through encyclopaedia entries, seminars and 
grant programs, to C14 dates, archaeological sites and spatial 
databases. It allows users to attach multimedia resources 
and annotations to each entity in the database, using private, 
public, and group-restricted wiki entries. Some entries can be 
locked off as authoritative content, others can be left open to 
all comers.
Effective geographic and temporal contextualisation and linking 
between entities provides new opportunities for Humanities 
research, particularly in History and Archaeology. Heurist 
allows the user to digitize and attach geographic data to any 
entity type, to attach photographs and other media to entities, 
and to store annotated, date-stamped relationships between 
entities. These are the key to linking bibliographic entries to 
other types of entity and building, browsing and visualizing 
networks of related entities.
Heurist represents a fi rst step towards building a single point 
of entry Virtual Research Environment for the Humanities. 
It already provides ‘instant’ web services, such as mapping, 
timelines, styled output through XSLT and various XML feeds 
(XML, KML, RSS) allowing it to serve as one component in a 
decentralized system. The next version will operate in a peer-
to-peer network of instances which can share data with one 
another and with other applications.
The service at HeuristScholar.org is freely available for 
academic use and has been used to construct projects as varied 
as the University of Sydney Archaeology department website, 
content management for the Dictionary of Sydney project (a 
major project to develop an online historical account of the 
history of Sydney) and an historical event browser for the 
Rethinking Timelines project.
