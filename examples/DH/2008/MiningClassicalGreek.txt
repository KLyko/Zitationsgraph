 This paper examines gendered language in classical Greek 
drama. Recent years have seen the emergence of data mining in 
the Humanities, and questions of gender have been asked from 
the start. Work by Argamon and others has studied gender in 
English, both for the gender of authors of texts (Koppel et al. 
2002, Argamon et al. 2003) and for that of characters in texts 
(Hota et al. 2006, 2007 on Shakespeare); Argamon et al. (in 
prep. a) study gender as a variable in Alexander Street Press’s 
Black Drama corpus (gender of authors and characters) and 
(in prep. b) in French literature (gender of authors).
Surprisingly, some of the main fi ndings of these studies show 
signifi cant overlap: Female authors and characters use more 
personal pronouns and negations than males; male authors 
and characters use more determiners and quantifi ers. Not 
only, then, do dramatic characters in Shakespeare and modern 
drama, like male and female authors, prove susceptible to 
automated analysis, but the feature sets that separate male 
from female characters show remarkable continuity with 
those that separate male from female authors.
For a scholar of Greek, this overlap between actual people 
and dramatic characters holds great promise. Since there 
are barely any extant Greek texts written by women, these 
results for English give us some hope that the corpus of Greek 
drama may serve as evidence for women’s language in classical 
Greek.
After all, if the results for English-language literature showed 
signifi cant differences between male and female characters, 
but no parallels with the differences found between male 
and female authors, we would be left with a study of gender 
characterization by dramatists with no known relation to the 
language of actual women. This is certainly of interest from a 
literary and stylistic point of view, but from a linguistic point 
of view, the English data hold out the promise that what we 
learn from Greek tragedy will tell us about gendered use of 
Greek language more generally, which is arguably a question 
of larger import, and one we have practically no other means 
of learning about.
There is some contemporary evidence to suggest that Greek 
males considered the portrayal of women on stage to be true 
to life. Plato’s Socrates advises in the Republic against actors 
portraying women. Imitation must lead to some aspects of 
these inferior beings rubbing off on the (exclusively male) actors 
(Republic 3.394-395). Aristophanes, the comic playwright, has 
Euripides boast (Frogs 949f.) that he made tragedy democratic, 
allowing a voice to women and slaves alongside men.
Gender, of course, also continues to fascinate modern readers 
of these plays. For instance, Griffi th (1999: 51) writes, on 
Antigone: “Gender lies at the root of the problems of Antigone. 
(...) Sophocles has created one of the most impressive female 
fi gures ever to walk the stage.” Yet there are no full-scale 
studies of the linguistic characteristics of female speech on 
the Greek stage (pace McClure 1999).
In this paper, we report our results on data mining for gender 
in Greek drama. We started with the speakers in four plays of 
Sophocles (Ajax, Antigone, Electra, and Trachiniae), for a total of 
thirty characters, in order to test, fi rst of all, whether a small, 
non-lemmatized Greek drama corpus would yield any results 
at all. We amalgamated the text of all characters by hand into 
individual fi les per speaker and analyzed the resulting corpus 
with PhiloMine, the data mining extension to PhiloLogic (http://
philologic.uchicago.edu/philomine).
In this initial experiment, words were not lemmatized, and 
only occurrences of individual words, not bigrams or trigrams, 
were used. In spite of the modest size, results have been 
positive. The small corpus typically resulted in results of 
“100% correct” classifi cation on different tasks, which is to 
be expected as a result of overfi tting to the small amount of 
data. More signifi cantly, results on cross-validation were in the 
80% range, whereas results on random falsifi cation stayed near 
50%. We were aware of other work on small corpora (Yu 2007 
on Dickinson), but were heartened by these positive results 
with PhiloMine, which had so far been used on much larger 
collections.
In our presentation, we will examine two questions in more 
depth, and on the basis of a larger corpus.
First, there is the overlap found between work on English and 
French. Argamon et al. (2007) laid down the gauntlet:
“The strong agreement between the analyses is all the more 
remarkable for the very different texts involved in these two 
studies. Argamon et al. (2003) analyzed 604 documents from 
the BNC spanning an array of fi ction and non-fi ction categories 
from a variety of types of works, all in Modern British English 
(post-1960), whereas the current study looks at longer, 
predominantly fi ctional French works from the 12th - 20th 
centuries. This cross-linguistic similarity could be supported 
with further research in additional languages.”
So do we fi nd the same tendencies in Greek, and if so, are 
we dealing with human, or ‘Western’ cultural, universals? 
Our initial results were mixed. When we ran a multinomial 
Bayes (MNB) analysis on a balanced sample, we did indeed see 
some negations show up as markers for female characters (3 
negations in a top 50 of ‘female’ features; none in the male top

50), but pronouns and determiners show up in feature sets 
for both the female and male corpus. An emphatic form of the 
pronoun ‘you’ turned up as the most strongly male feature in 
this same analysis, and two more personal pronouns showed 
up in the male top ten, as against only one in the female top 
ten. Lexical items, on the other hand, were more intuitively 
distributed. Words such as ‘army’, ‘man’, ‘corpse’ and ‘weapons’ 
show up prominently on the male list; two past tense forms of 
‘die’ show up in the female top ten. A larger corpus will allow 
us to report more fully on the distribution of function words 
and content words, and on how selections for frequency 
infl uence classifi er results.
Secondly, after expanding our corpus, regardless of whether we 
fi nd similar general results for Greek as for English and French, 
we will also be able to report on variation among the three 
tragedians, and give more fi ne-grained analysis. For instance, 
in our initial sample, we categorized gods and choruses as 
male or female along with the other characters (there are 
usually indications in the text as to the gender of the chorus 
in a given play, say ‘sailors’, ‘male elders’, ‘women of Trachis’). 
Given the formal requirements of the genre, we expect that it 
will be trivial to classify characters as ‘chorus’ vs. ‘non-chorus’, 
but it will be interesting to see whether gender distinctions 
hold up within the group of choruses, and to what extent 
divinities conform to gender roles. The goddess Athena was 
the character most often mis-classifi ed in our initial sample; 
perhaps this phenomenon will be more widespread in the full 
corpus. Such a fi nding would suggest (if not for the fi rst time, 
of course) that authority and gender intersect in important 
ways, even as early as the ancient Greeks’ conceptions of their 
gods.
In conclusion, we hope to demonstrate that data mining 
Greek drama brings new insights, despite the small size of the 
corpus and the intense scrutiny that it has already seen over 
the centuries. A quantitative study of this sort has value in its 
own right, but can also be a springboard for close readings 
of individual passages and form the foundation for a fuller 
linguistic and literary analysis.
