 This paper documents an exploratory research in progress, 
investigating the relationship between the quality of digital 
interfaces, their technical conditions and the interfacial 
mediation of the users’ body. Here, we focus on the bodily 
dimension of gender. For this reason, we analysed two online 
role playing games with different representation modes 
(text-based versus image-based) asking which impact the 
digital interface and their technical conditions have on gender 
performances.
Following sociological investigations (Bahl, 1998/ Goffman, 
2001/ Lübke, 2005/ Müller, 1996), the bodily aspect of gender 
plays a central role in communication settings due to its 
social, cultural meaning which nowadays strongly is mediated 
by information technology. For this reason, we focus on the 
interfaces. We claim that their representation mode, their 
design and software constraints have a crucial impact on the 
virtual patterns of gender referring to individual performance, 
spatial movement and communication. 
This interfacial analysis is just a part of an interdisciplinary 
inquiry about the interrelation between gender, design and 
ICT. It is allocated in the overlapping fi eld of sociology, gender 
studies, design research and information technology. 
In this respect, we regard the body and its gender as culturally 
constructed interface of social interactions and advocate for 
refl ecting it within the process software development and 
interface design. 
Introduction
Today’s communication is highly infl uenced by information 
technology, which substitutes more and more physical body 
representations in face-to-face communication. Disembodied 
experiences have become a part of ordinary life as self 
performances and interactions are often mediated by designed 
hardware and software interfaces.
In this context, designers who make ICT accessible via their 
product and screen designs can be regarded as mediators 
between technological requirements and user needs. 
They usually regard interfaces from the point of view of 
formal-aesthetic (Apple Computer, Inc, 1992; McKey, 1999; 
Schneiderman/ Plaisant, 2005), or of usability (Krug, 2006; 
Nielsen/ Loranger, 2006) and interaction-design (Cooper/ 
Reimann, 2003; Preece/ Rogers/ Sharp, 2002). But designers 
not only make ICT usable, but also culturally signifi cant. In this 
respect, they also deal with the cultural constructions and 
implications of gender which have to be refl ected by their 
screen designs. The interfacial conditions decide about the 
bodily representations in ICT interaction.
By referring to interactionist (Goffman, 2001), constructivist 
(Butler, 2006/ Teubner, Wetterer, 1999/ Trettin, 1997/
West, Zimmermann, 1991, 1995) theories and sociological 
investigations of virtual environments (Eisenrieder, 2003/ 
Lübke, 2005/ Turkle, 1999), we claim that the bodily aspect 
of gender is an essential reference point of individual 
performance, communication, even spatial movements not 
as a physical property of the body, but due to its cultural 
meaning and connotative potential. It is supposed to be the 
most guiding information referring to interaction contexts 
(Goffman, 2001/ Lübke, 2005). It has a crucial impact on the 
behavior: Being polite, e.g. opening the door for someone is 
often a decision made in dependence of the counterpart’s 
gender (Müller, 1996). Not knowing about it causes behavioral 
confusion (Bahl, 1998/ Lübke, 2005). 
Research Perspectives & Research 
Questions
In contrast to a sociological point of view, a conventional 
design perspective or technological requirements, we add a 
completely new aspect to design and technologically driven 
inquiries in two respects:
- By taking the body as a benchmark for analyzing gender 
representations of digital interfaces. 
- By investigating the virtual body and its gender 
representations from an interfacial point of view.
Our investigations and refl ections are guided by the 
following questions:
- Which gender images do exist in virtual spaces?
- Which impact do the digital interface and their technical 
conditions have on gender performances?
Furthermore, we are particularly interested in knowing about 
the impact of design on preserving traditional and stereotype 
gender images as well as on modifying or deconstructing 
them.

Objects of Investigation
Objects of investigations are two online role playing games, 
so called Multi User Dungeons (MUDs). They are especially 
suitable for this purpose because they directly refer to bodily 
representations in form of virtual characters. We choose 
two MUDs with different representation modes in order 
to compare the effects of opposite interfaces on the virtual 
embodiment of gender: LambdaMOO, a popular text-based 
online role playing game (see Image 1 LM), is contrasted 
with Second Life, the currently most popular and populated 
graphical MUD (see Image 1 SL). Examining their interfaces 
promise to get concrete insights into the interfacial infl uence 
on virtual gender images. 
Image 1 LM: Interface
Image 1 SL: Interface
Methodology
We use the methods of content analysis and participatory 
observation – the fi rst in order to explore the interfacial offer 
of options and tools to create virtual gender representations 
and the second in order to know, how it feels developing 
and wearing the respective gendered skin. The analysis and 
observations are guided and structured using the different 
dimensions of the body as a matrix of investigating which 
are empirically generated from the observations themselves. 
Within these bodily categories, different aspects of gender are 
identifi ed:
Body presence 
- modes of existence or being there
Personality / individuality
- forms of personal performance
- forms of non-verbal communication (facial expressions, 
gestures, vocal intonations and accentuation)
- modes of emotional expressions
Patterns of gender
- categories or models of gender
Actions and spatial Movements
- modes of behavior and actions
- modes of spatial orientation and navigation
Patterns of social behavior
- modes of communication and interaction
- community standards, behavioral guidelines and rules 
Research Results
The main fi ndings show, how interfaces and their specifi c 
technical conditions can expand or restrict the performance 
of gender. Moreover, they demonstrate how the conventional 
bipolar gender model of western culture can be re- and 
deconstructed by the interfacial properties and capacities. 
The table below gives a summarizing overview about how 
the different bodily aspects are treated by the respective 
interface of LambdaMOO or Second Life. Interfacial elements 
which explicitly address gender aspects are indicated in bold 
italics. Reference to images are marked “see Image # LM 
(LambdaMOO)/SL(Second Life)”.

Body aspect LambdaMOO (text-based) Second Life (image-based)
Body presence
(addressing more or 
less explicitly cultural 
associations of gender) 
Nickname: 
Renaming is possible 
at any time 
(See Image 2.1 LM 
and Image 2.2 LM)
Nickname: 
name is predetermined by the 
interface (surname is selectable 
from a list, the availability of the 
combination of fore and sure 
name has to be checked by the 
system); name can‘t be changed 
after being registered (See 
Image 2.1 SL and Image 2.2 SL)
Avatar:
after registration, a character 
has to be selected of a default 
set of 6 male and female 
avatars (See Image 3 SL) which 
can be individually modifi ed 
by the ‘Appearance Editor’
Personality/ individuality Self-descriptions command - Appearance Editor: 
just offers the gender 
categories ‘male and 
female’, but allows to create 
transgender images (See 
Image 7.1 SL and Image 7.2 SL)
- Profi le Window
Emote-command Set of gestures: 
differentiated into common 
and male/ female gestures 
corresponding to the 
avatar’s gender (See Image 
9.1 SL, Image 9.2 SL,  Image 
10.1 SL and Image 10.2 SL)
Actions and spatial 
movements
Emote-command Set of gestures: 
differentiated into common 
and male/ female gestures 
corresponding to the 
avatar’s gender
- Moving-around commands: 
(cardinal points + up/down)
- Look-around commands
- Navigation tool:
the avatar’s movements are 
programmed corresponding 
to gender stereotypes:
female avatars walk with 
swinging hips while male 
avatars walk bowlegged 
(See Image 8.1 SL)
- Camera-view tool
- Sit down / Stand 
up command:
the avatar’s movements are 
programmed corresponding 
to gender stereotypes: 
female avatars sit 
close-legged, while male 
avatars sit bowlegged 
(See Image 8.2 SL)
- Teleporting
- Examine-object commands - Take-object command
Patterns of gender 10 gender categories:
Neuter, male, female, 
either, Spivak (“To adopt 
the Spivak gender means 
to abjure the gendering 
of the body ,to refuse to 
be cast as male, female 
or transsexual.” Thomas, 
2003)), splat, plural, 
egoistical, royal, 2nd
(See Image 4.1 LM 
and Image 4.2 LM)
Male, female:
Changing the gender 
category is possible at any 
time by the ‘Appearance 
Editor’ (See Image 6 SL); 
naked male avatars 
are sexless(See Image 
5.1 SL); female avatars 
have breast but also no 
genital; masculinity can be 
emphasized by editing the 
genital area of the avatar‘s 
trousers (See Image 5.2 SL 
and Image 5.3) femininity 
by the size of breast and 
their position to each other 
(together or more distant)
Set of male / female 
gestures (See Image 10.1 
SL and Image 10.2 SL): 
Female gesture set with 18 
versus male gesture set 
with 12 categories, may 
support the stereotype 
of females being more 
emotionally expressive
Virtual patterns of 
social behavior
Chat-command: say Chat-commands: speak / shout
Some gestures are 
accompanied by vocal 
expressions which are 
differentiated into male 
and female voices
Long-distance-
communication command
Instant Messenger
Behavioral guidelines Community Standards: 
‘Big Six’& Policy includes 
the topic ‘harassment’ 
which mainly affects 
females personas
Abuse Reporter Tool 
Reporting violations 
directly to the creators of 
Second Life ‘Linden Lab’

The comparison demonstrates that both interfaces use nearly 
the same patterns of embodiment. Referring to the bodily 
aspect of gender, Second Life is a poor and conservative space. 
Gender modifi cations besides the common model seem not 
to be intended by the interface: In case of gender switches the 
gender specifi c gestures set does not shift correspondently 
(see images 11.1 SL and11.2 SL).

Image 11.1 SL: Female gestures - male avatar
Image 11.2 SL: Male gestures - female avatar
In case of a male-to-female modifi cation, the avatars clothes 
do not fi t any more (see image 12 SL).
Image 12 SL: Female to male swap - unfi tting clothes
In contrast to that, LambdaMOO questions the analogue gender 
model by violating and expanding it up to 10 categories. 
Outlook
This inquiry belongs to a design research project which 
generally deals with the relation between gender and design. 
It aims at the development of a gender sensitive design 
approach investigating the potential of gender modifi cation 
and deconstruction by design.
