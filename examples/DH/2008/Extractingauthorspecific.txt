Introduction  
This study applies stylistic text classifi cation using random 
forest to extract author-specifi c expressions for use in the 
sociolinguistic analysis of political speeches. In the fi eld of 
politics, the style of political leaders’ speeches, as well as their 
content, has attracted growing attention in both English (Ahren, 
2005) and Japanese (Azuma, 2006; Suzuki and Kageura, 2006). 
One of the main purposes of these studies is to investigate 
political leaders’ individual and political styles by analyzing their 
speech styles. A common problem of many of these studies 
and also many sociolinguistic studies is that the expressions 
that are analyzed are selected solely on the basis of the 
researcher’s interests or preferences, which can sometimes 
lead to contradictory interpretations. In other words, it is 
diffi cult to determine whether these kind of analyses have 
in fact correctly identifi ed political leaders’ individual speech 
styles and, on this basis, correctly characterised their individual 
and political styles. Another problem is that political leaders’ 
speech styles may also be characterised by the infrequent use 
of specifi c expressions, but this is rarely focused on.  
In order to solve these problems, we decided to apply stylistic 
text classifi cation and feature extraction using random forest 
to political speeches. By classifying the texts of an author 
according to their style and extracting the variables contributing 
to this classifi cation, we can identify the expressions specifi c 
to that author. This enables us to determine his/her speech 
style, including the infrequent use of specifi c expressions, and 
characterise his/her individual and political style. This method 
can be used for the sociolinguistic analysis of various types 
of texts, which is, according to Argamon et al. (2007a), a 
potentially important area of application for stylistics.  
Experimental setup  
We selected the Diet addresses of two Japanese prime 
ministers, Nakasone and Koizumi, and performed two 
classifi cation experiments: we distinguished Nakasone’s 
addresses from those of his 3 contemporaries (1980-1989), 
and Koizumi’s addresses from those of his 8 contemporaries 
(1989-2006). Because Nakasone and Koizumi were two of 
the most powerful prime ministers in the history of Japanese 
politics, and took a special interest in the content or style of

their own speeches (Suzuki and Kageura, 2007), their addresses 
are the most appropriate candidates for initial analysis. Suzuki 
and Kageura (2006) have demonstrated that the style of 
Japanese prime ministers’ addresses has changed signifi cantly 
over time, so we compared their addresses with those of 
their respective contemporaries selected by the standard 
division of eras in Japanese political history. We downloaded 
the addresses from the online database Sekai to Nihon (The 
World and Japan) (www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~worldjpn), and 
applied morphological analysis to the addresses using ChaSen 
(Matsumoto et al., 2003). We united notational differences 
which were distinguished only by kanji and kana in Japanese. 
Table 1 sets out the number of addresses and the total number 
of tokens and types for all words, particles and auxiliary verbs 
in each category.  
Table 1. Basic data on the corpora
As a classifi cation method, we selected the random forest (RF) 
method proposed by Breiman (2001), and evaluated the results 
using out-of-bag tests. RF is known to perform extremely well 
in classifi cation tasks in other fi elds using large amounts of 
data, but to date few studies have used this method in the area 
of stylistics (Jin and Murakami, 2006). Our fi rst aim in using RF 
was thus to test its effectiveness in stylistic text classifi cation. 
A second and more important aim was to extract the 
important variables contributing to classifi cation (which are 
shown as high Gini coeffi cients). The extracted variables 
represent the specifi c expressions distinguishing the author 
from others, and they can show the author’s special preference 
or dislike for specifi c expressions. Examining these extracted 
expressions enables us to determine the author’s speech style 
and characterise his/her individual and political styles. In an 
analogous study, Argamon et al. (2007b) performed gender-
based classifi cation and feature extraction using SVM and 
information gain, but as they are separate experiments and RF 
returns relevant variables contributing to classifi cation, RF is 
more suitable for our purposes.  
We decided to focus on the distribution of particles and 
auxiliary verbs because they represent the modality of 
the texts, information representing authors’ personality 
and sentiments (Otsuka et al., 2007), and are regarded as 
refl ecting political leaders’ individual and political styles clearly 
in Japanese (Azuma, 2006, Suzuki and Kageura, 2006). We 
tested 8 distribution combinations as features (see Table 2). 
Though Jin (1997) has demonstrated that the distribution of 
particles (1st order part-of-speech tag) is a good indicator of 
the author in Japanese, the performances of these features, 
especially auxiliary verbs, have not been explored fully, and 
as the microscopic differences in features (order of part-of-
speech and stemming) can affect the classifi cation accuracy, we 
decided to test the 8 combinations.  
Results and discussion  
Table 2 shows the precision, recall rates and F-values. Koizumi 
displayed higher accuracy than Nakasone, partly because he 
had a more individualistic style of speech (see also Figure 2 
and 3), and partly because a larger number of texts were used 
in his case. Many of the feature sets show high classifi cation 
accuracy (more than 70%) according to the criteria of an 
analogous study (Argamon et al., 2007c), which confi rms 
the high performance of RF. The results also show that the 
distribution of the auxiliary verbs and combinations can give 
better performance than that of the particles used in a previous 
study (Jin, 1997), and also that stemming and a deeper order of 
part-of-speech can improve the results.  
Table 2. Precisions and recall rates
Figure 1 represents the top twenty variables with high Gini 
coeffi cients according to the classifi cation of combinations of 
features (2nd order and with stemming). The fi gure indicates 
that several top variables had an especially important role in 
classifi cation. In order to examine them in detail, we plotted in 
Figure 2 and 3 the transitions in the relative frequencies of the 
top four variables in the addresses of all prime ministers after 
World War 2. These include variables representing politeness 
(‘masu’, ‘aru’, ‘desu’), assertion (‘da’, ‘desu’), normativeness 
(‘beshi’), and intention (‘u’), and show the individual and political 
styles of these two prime ministers well. For example, ‘aru’ is 
a typical expression used in formal speeches, and also Diet 
addresses (Azuma, 2006), and the fact that Koizumi used this 
expression more infrequently than any other prime minister 
indicates his approachable speech style and can explain his 
political success. Also, the fi gure shows that we can extract the 
expressions that Nakasone and Koizumi used less frequently 
than their contemporaries as well as the expressions they 
used frequently. These results show the effectiveness of RF 
feature extraction for the sociolinguistic analysis of political 
speeches.

The notations of the variables indicate the name of part-
of-speech (p: particle, av: auxiliary verb) followed by (in 
the case of particles) the 2nd order part-of speech.

Conclusion  
This study applied text classifi cation and feature extraction 
using random forest for use in the sociolinguistic analysis of 
political speeches. We showed that a relatively new method 
in stylistics performs fairly well, and enables us to extract 
author-specifi c expressions. In this way, we can systematically 
determine the expressions that should be analyzed to 
characterise their individual and political styles. This method 
can be used for the sociolinguistic analysis of various types of 
texts, which will contribute to further expansion in the scope 
of stylistics. A further study will include more concrete analysis 
of extracted expressions.
