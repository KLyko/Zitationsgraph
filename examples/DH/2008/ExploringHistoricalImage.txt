The US Government Photos and Graphics Collection include 
some of the nation’s most precious historical documents. 
However the current federation is not effective for 
exploration. We propose an architecture that enables users 
to collaboratively construct a faceted classifi cation for this 
historical image collection, or any other large online multimedia 
collections. We have implemented a prototype for the 
American Political History multimedia collection from usa.gov, 
with a collaborative faceted classifi cation interface. In addition, 
the proposed architecture includes automated document 
classifi cation and facet schema enrichment techniques.
Introduction
It is diffi cult to explore a large historical multimedia humanities 
collection without a classifi cation scheme. Legacy items 
often lack textual description or other forms of metadata, 
which makes search very diffi cult. One common approach 
is to have librarians classify the documents in the collection. 
This approach is often time or cost prohibitive, especially 
for large, growing collections.  Furthermore, the librarian 
approach cannot refl ect diverse and ever-changing needs and 
perspectives of users. As Sir Tim Berners-Lee commented: “the 
exciting thing [about Web] is serendipitous reuse of data: one 
person puts data up there for one thing, and another person 
uses it another way.” Recent social tagging systems such as del.
icio.us permit individuals to assign free-form keywords (tags) 
to any documents in a collection. In other words, users can 
contribute metadata. These tagging systems, however, suffer 
from low quality of tags and lack of navigable structures.
The system we are developing improves access to a large 
multimedia collection by supporting users collaboratively 
build a faceted classifi cation. Such a collaborative approach 
supports diverse and evolving user needs and perspectives. 
Faceted classifi cation has been shown to be effective for 
exploration and discovery in large collections [1]. Compared 
to search, it allows for recognition of category names instead 
of recalling of query keywords. Faceted classifi cation consists 
of two components: the facet schema containing facets and 
categories, and the association between each document and 
the categories in the facet schema. Our system allows users to 
collaboratively 1) evolve a schema with facets and categories, 
and 2) to classify documents into this schema. Through users’ 
manual efforts and aided by the system’s automated efforts, a 
faceted classifi cation evolves with the growing collection, the 
expanding user base, and the shifting user interests. 
Our fundamental belief is that a large, diverse group of people 
(students, teachers, etc.) can do better than a small team 
of librarians in classifying and enriching a large multimedia 
collection.
Related Research
Our research builds upon popular wiki and social tagging 
systems. Below we discuss several research projects closest 
to ours in spirit.
The Flamenco project [1] has developed a good browsing 
interface based on faceted classifi cation, and has gone through 
extensive evaluation with digital humanities collections such as 
the fi ne art images at the museums in San Francisco. Flamenco, 
however, is a “read-only” system. The facet schema is pre-
defi ned, and the classifi cation is pre-loaded. Users will not be 
able to change the way the documents are classifi ed.
The Facetag project [2] guides users’ tagging by presenting a 
predetermined facet schema to users. While users participate 
in classifying the documents, the predetermined facet schema 
forces users to classify the documents from the system’s 
perspective. The rigid schema is insuffi cient in supporting 
diverse user perspectives. 
A few recent projects [4, 7] attempt to create classifi cation 
schemas from tags collected from social tagging systems. So far 
these projects have generated only single hierarchies, instead 
of multiple hierarchies as in faceted schemas. Also just as 
any other data mining systems, these automatic classifi cation 
approaches suffers from quality problems. 
So far, no one has combined user efforts and automated 
techniques to build a faceted classifi cation, both to build the 
schema and to classify documents into it, in a collaborative and 
interactive manner.

Architecture and Prototype 
Implementation
The architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1. Users 
can not only tag (assign free-form keywords to) documents 
but also collaboratively build a faceted classifi cation in a wiki 
fashion. Utilizing the metadata created by users’ tagging efforts 
and harvested from other sources, the system help improve 
the classifi cation. We focus on three novel features: 1) to allow 
users collaboratively build and maintain a faceted classifi cation, 
2) to systematically enrich the user-created facet schema, 3) 
to automatically classify documents into the evolving facet 
schema. 
Figure 1. System Architecture
We have developed a Web-based interface that allows 
users create and edit facets/categories similar to managing 
directories in the Microsoft File Explorer. Simply by clicking 
and dragging documents into faceted categories, users can 
classify (or re-classify) historic documents. All the fi les and 
documents are stored in a MySQL database.  For automatic 
classifi cation, we use a support vector machine method [5] 
utilizing users’ manual classifi cation as training input. For 
systematic facet enrichment, we are exploring methods that 
create new faceted categories from free-form tags based on a 
statistical co-occurrence model [6] and also WordNet [8]. 
Note that the architecture has an open design so that it can 
be integrated with existing websites or content management 
systems. As such the system can be readily deployed to enrich 
existing digital humanity collections.
We have deployed a prototype on the American Political 
History (APH) sub-collection (http://teachpol.tcnj.edu/
amer_pol_hist) of the US Government Photos and Graphics 
Collection, a federated collection with millions of images 
(http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Graphics.shtml). The APH 
collection currently contains over 500 images, many of which 
are among the nation’s most valuable historical documents. 
On the usa.gov site, users can explore this collection only 
by two ways: either by era, such as 18th century and 19th 
century, or by special topics, such as “presidents” (Figure 2). 
There are only four special topics manually maintained by the 
collection administrator, which do not cover most items in 
the collection. This collection is poor with metadata and tools, 
which is common to many digital humanity collections that 
contain legacy items that have little pre-existing metadata, or 
lack resources for maintenance.

The prototype focused on the collaborative classifi cation 
interface. After deploying our prototype, the collection has 
been collaboratively classifi ed into categories along several 
facets. To prove the openness of system architecture, the 
prototype has been integrated with different existing systems.

As users explore the system (such as by exploring faceted 
categories or through a keyword search), besides each item 
there is a “classify” button which leads to the classifi cation 
interface. The classifi cation interface shows the currently 
assigned categories in various facets for the selected item. It 
allows user to drag and drop an item into a new category. At 
this level user can also add or remove categories from a facet, 
or add or remove a facet.

Evaluation and Future Steps
Initial evaluation results in a controlled environment show 
great promise. The prototype was tested by university students 
interested in American political history. The collection was 
collaboratively categorized into facets such as Artifact (map, 
photo, etc.), Location, Year, and Topics (Buildings, Presidents, 
etc.) The prototype is found to be more effective than the 
original website in supporting user’s retrieval tasks, in terms 
of both recall and precision. At this time, our prototype does 
not have all the necessary support to be deployed on public 
Internet for a large number of users. For this we need to work 
on the concept of hardening a newly added category or facet. 
The key idea behind hardening is to accept a new category or

facet only after reinforcement from multiple users. In absence 
of hardening support our system will be overwhelmed by 
the number of new facets and categories.    We are also 
exploring automated document classifi cation and facet schema 
enrichment techniques. We believe that collaborative faceted 
classifi cation can improve access to many digital humanities 
collections.
