The implicit connections and cross-references between and 
within texts, which occur in all print collections, can be made 
explicit in a collection of electronic texts. Correctly encoded 
and exposed they create a framework to support resource 
discovery and navigation by following links between topics. This 
framework provides opportunities to visualise dense points 
of interconnection and, deployed across otherwise separate 
collections, can reveal unforeseen networks and associations. 
Thus approached, the creation and online delivery of digital 
texts moves from a digital library model with its goal as the 
provision of access, to a digital humanities model directed 
towards the innovative use of information technologies to 
derive new knowledge from our cultural inheritance.
Using this approach the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre 
(NZETC) has developed a delivery system for its collection of 
over 2500 New Zealand and Pacic Island texts using TEI XML, 
the ISO Topic Map technology1 and innovative entity authority 
management. Like a simple back-of-book index but on a much 
grander scale, a topic map aggregates information to provide 
binding points from which everything that is known about a 
given subject can be reached. The ontology which structures 
the relationships between dierent types of topics is based on 
the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model2 and can therefore 
accommodate a wide range of types. To date the NZETC 
Topic Map has included only those topics and relationships 
which are simple, veriable and object based. Topics currently 
represent authors and publishers, texts and images, as well as 
people and places mentioned or depicted in those texts and 
images. This has proved successful in presenting the collection 
as a resource for research, but work is now underway to 
expand the structured mark-up embedded in texts to encode 
scholarly thinking about a set of resources. Topic-based 
navigable linkages between texts will include ‘allusions’ and 
‘infl uence’ (both of one text upon another and of an abstract 
idea upon a corpus, text, or fragment of text).3
Importantly, the topic map extends beyond the NZETC 
collection to incorporate relevant external resources which 
expose structured metadata about entities in their collection 
(see Figure 1).

Cross-collection linkages are particularly valuable where 
they reveal interdisciplinary connections which can provide 
fertile ground for analysis. For example the National Library 
of New Zealand hosts a full text archive of the Transactions 
and Proceedings of the Royal Society containing New Zealand 
science writing 1868-1961. By linking people topics in the 
NZETC collection to articles authored in the Royal Society 
collection it is possible to discern an interesting overlap 
between the 19th century community of New Zealand Pakeha 
artists and early colonial geologists and botanists.
In order to achieve this interlinking, between collections, and 
across institutional and disciplinary boundaries, every topic 
must be uniquely and correctly identied. In a large, full text 
collection the same name may refer to multiple entities,4 while 
a single entity may be known by many names.5 When working 
across collections it is necessary to be able to condently 
identify an individual in a variety of contexts. Authority control 
is consequently of the utmost importance in preventing 
confusion and chaos.
The library world has of course long worked with authority 
control systems, but the model underlying most such systems 
is inadequate for a digital world. Often the identier for an 
entity is neither persistent nor unique, and a single name or 
form of a name is unnecessarily privileged (indeed, stands in as 
the entity itself). In order to accommodate our goals for the 
site, the NZETC created the Entity Authority Tool Set (EATS),6 
an authority control system that provides unique, persistent, 
sharable7 identiers for any sort of entity. The system has two 
particular benets in regards to the needs of digital humanities 
researchers for what the ACLS described as a robust cyber 
infrastructure.8
Firstly, EATS enables automatic processing of names within 
textual material. When dealing with a large collection, resource 
constraints typically do not permit manual processing -- 
for example, marking up every name with a pointer to the 
correct record in the authority list, or simply recognising 
text strings as names to begin with. To make this process at 
least semi-automated, EATS stores names broken down (as 
much as possible) into component parts. By keeping track of 
language and script information associated with the names, 
the system is able to use multiple sets of rules to know how 
to properly glue these parts together into valid name forms. 
So, for example, William Herbert Ellery Gilbert might be 
referred to in a text by “William Gilbert”, “W. H. E. Gilbert”, 
“Gilbert, Wm.”, or a number of other forms; all of these can be 
automatically recognised due to the language and script rules 
associated with the system. Similarly Chiang Kai-shek, being a 
Chinese name, should be presented with the family name fi rst, 
and, when written in Chinese script, without a space between 
the name parts (蒋介石).
Figure 1: A mention of Samuel Marsden in a given text 
is linked to a topic page for Marsden which in turn 
provides links to other texts which mention him, external 
resources about him and to the full text of works that he 
has authored both in the NZETC collection and in other 
online collections entirely separate from the NZETC.
The ability to identify entities within plain text and add 
structured, machine-readable mark-up contributes to the 
growth of electronic text corpora suitable for the types of 
computational analysis oered by projects such as the MONK 
environment.9 This is, however, distinct from the problem of 
identifying substrings within a text that might be names, but 
that are not found within EATS. This problem, though signicant, 
does not fall within the main scope of the EATS system.10 
Similarly, disambiguating multiple matches for the same name 
is generally best left to the determination of a human being: 
even date matches are too often problematic.11
Secondly, the system is built around the need to allow for 
an entity to carry sometimes confl icting, or merely dierent, 
information from multiple sources, and to reference those 
sources.12 Having information from multiple sources aids in 
the process of disambiguating entities with the same names; 
just as important is being able to link out to other relevant 
resources. For example, our topic page for William Colenso 
links not only to works in the NZETC collection, but also to 
works in other collections, where the information on those 
other collections is part of the EATS record.
It is, however, barely sucient to link in this way directly from 
one project to another. EATS, being a web application, can itself 
be exposed to the net and act as a central hub for information 
and resources pertaining to the entities within the system. 
Since all properties of an entity are made as assertions by 
an organisation, EATS allows multiple such organisations to 
use and modify records without touching anyone else’s data; 
adding data harvesting to the mix allows for centralisation of 
information (and, particularly, pointers to further information) 
without requiring much organisational centralisation.

One benefi t of this approach is handling entities about which 
there is substantial dierence of view. With topics derived 
from research (such as ideas and events) there are likely 
to be dierences of opinion as to both the identifi cation of 
entities and the relationships between them. For example 
one organisation may see one event where another sees two. 
To be able to model this as three entities, with relationships 
between them asserted by the organisations, a potentially 
confusing situation becomes clear, without any group having 
to give up its own view of the world. The EATS system can 
achieve this because all information about an entity is in the 
form of a property assertion made by a particular authority in 
a particular record (see fi gure 2).
The technologies developed and deployed by the NZETC 
including EATS are all based on open standards. The tools and 
frameworks that have been created are designed to provide 
durable resources to meet the needs of the academic and wider 
community in that they promote interlinking between digital 
collections and projects and are themselves interoperable with 
other standards-based programs and applications including 
web-based references tools, eResearch virtual spaces and 
institutional repositories.
Figure 2: The EATS objects and basic relationships
Only once both cultural heritage institutions and digital 
humanities projects adopt suitable entity identiers and 
participate in a shared mapping system such as EATS, can there 
exist unambiguous discovery of both individual resources and 
connections between them. The wider adoption of this type 
of entity authority system will contribute substantially to the 
creation of the robust cyber infrastructure that will, in the 
words of the ACLS “allow digital scholarship to be cumulative, 
collaborative, and synergistic.”

refer to multiple people who have it as part of their full name.

10 EATS can be provided with name data on which to make various 
judgements (such as non-obvious abbreviations like Wm for William), 
and it would be trivial to get a list of individual parts of names from 
the system, for identication purposes, but there is no code for actually 
performing this process.
11 That said, the NZETC has had some success with automated 
ltering of duplicate matches into dierent categories, based on name 
and date similarity (not equality); publication dates provide a useful 
cut-o point for matching.

record.
