Representation of data on regional history by means of Web 
sites is practised in many countries, because such Web sites 
should perform – and more often than not they really perform 
– three important functions. First, they further preservation 
of historical information related to a certain region. Second, 
Web sites on regional history promote and publicize historical 
and cultural heritage of a region, hence they can serve as a 
specifi c ‘visiting-card’ of a region. Third, they facilitate progress 
in regional historical studies by means of involving researchers 
in Web-community and providing them with primary data 
and, at the same time, with appropriate research tools that 
can be used for data retrieving and processing. However, 
implementation of the above-mentioned functions calls for 
different information technologies. For instance, preservation 
of historical information requires structuring of information 
related to a certain region, therefore databases technologies 
should be used to perform this function. In order to draft and 
update a ‘visiting-card’ of a region, a Web site can be designed on 
the basis of Content Management System (CMS). Meanwhile, 
coordination of research activities within the frameworks of 
a certain Web-community calls for implementation of modern 
technologies in order to create knowledge-based information 
systems.
In this paper, a concept of a knowledge-based information 
system for regional historical studies is framed and a pattern of 
data representation, aggregation, and structuring is discussed. 
This pattern can be described as a specialized semantic network 
hereafter defi ned as Historical Semantic Network (HSN).
Up to now, the most popular pattern of representation 
of regional historical information is a traditional Web site 
that consists of static HTML-pages. A typical example is the 
Web site Latgales Dati (created in 1994, see http://dau.lv/ld), 
which provides information about the history and cultural 
heritage of Eastern Latvia – Latgale (Soms 1995; Soms and 
Ivanovs 2002). On the Web site Latgales Dati, historical data 
are stored and processed according to the above-mentioned 
traditional pattern. The shortcomings of this pattern are quite 
obvious: it is impossible to revise the mode of processing and 
representation of data on the Web site; it is rather diffi cult to 
feed in additional information, to retrieve necessary data, and 
to share information.
In the HEML project, a special language of representation 
and linkage of information on historical events has been 
developed (http://www.heml.org). Advantages of this language 
are generally known: a modern approach to processing and 
representation of historical information on the basis of XML, 
a developed system of tools of visualization of information, 
etc. However, the processing of information is subjected to 
descriptions of historical events. It can be regarded as a drawback 
of this language, since such descriptions do not form a solid 
basis for historical data representation in databases. Actually, 
any description of a historical event is an interpretation 
of narratives and documentary records. For this reason, 
databases should embrace diverse historical objects, namely, 
documents and narratives, persons, historical monuments and 
buildings, institutions, geographical sites, and so on, and so 
forth. These objects can be described using different attributes 
simultaneously, which specify characteristic features of the 
objects. Sometimes, objects can be labelled with defi nite, unique 
attributes only. The detailed, exhaustive information about 
the objects can be represented by means of links between 
objects, thus creating a specifi c semantic network. Within 
this network, paramount importance is attached to special 
temporal objects – the chronological ‘markers’. Connecting 
links between a number of historical objects, including special 
temporal objects, will form rather a solid basis for historical 
discourse upon historical events, processes, and phenomena.
The fi rst characteristic feature of the semantic network, which 
is being created on the basis of the Web site Latgales Dati, 
is the principle role assigned to such historical objects as 
documentary records and narratives. Thus, the connecting links 
between the objects are constituted (actually, reconstructed) in 
accordance with the evidences of historical sources. In order 
to provide facilities for verifi cation of the links, the semantic 
network should contain full texts of historical records as well 
as scanned raster images of them. On the one hand, texts 
and images can be directly connected with the objects of the 
semantic network by means of SVG technology; on the other 
hand, this connection can be established by means of mark-up 
schemes used in XML technology (Ivanovs and Varfolomeyev 
2005).
The second characteristic feature of HSN is fuzziness of almost 
all aspects of information in the semantic network (Klir and 
Yuan 1995). The source of this fuzziness is uncertainty of expert 
evaluations and interpretations of historical data; moreover, 
evidences of historical records can be either fragmentary and 
contradictory, or doubtful and uncertain. Therefore, the level of 
validity of information is ‘measured’ by variables, which can be 
expressed by ordinary numbers (0–1). However, it seems that 
they should be expressed by vector quantities as pairs (true, 
false); the components true and false can assume values from 
0 to 1. In this case, the pair (1,1) refers to very contradictory 
and unreliable information, meanwhile the pair (0,0) means

the absence of information. This approach was used in 
construction of four-valued logic (Belnap 1977). The fuzziness 
values defi ned for some objects can be propagated within a 
semantic network by means of logical reasoning (Hähnle 1993). 
This ‘measurement’ of validity of data is performed by users of 
HSN; the results of ‘measurement’ should be changeable and 
complementary, thus refl ecting cooperation of researchers 
within the frameworks of Web-community.
Creating a semantic network, a number of principal 
operations should be performed: reconstruction, linkage, and 
representation. Reconstruction is either manual or automatic 
generation of interrelations between objects that are not 
directly refl ected in historical records. In this stage, new 
historical objects can emerge; these objects are reconstructed 
in accordance with the system of their mutual relations. 
Linkage can be defi ned as detection of similar (in fuzzy sense) 
objects, which within a semantic network (or within a number 
of interrelated networks) form a defi nite unit. Representation is 
a number of operations of retrieving of data from the semantic 
network including representation of information by means of 
tables, graphs, timeline, geographic visualization, etc.
HSN as a basic pattern of representation of historical 
information in Internet provides researchers with proper 
tools, which can easily transform data retrieved from such 
Web sites. However, some problems should be solved in order 
to ‘substitute’ the traditional Web site Latgales Dati for HSN. 
There are different approaches to representation of semantic 
networks in Internet. A generally accepted approach is division 
of network links into subjects, predicates, and objects followed 
by their representation by means of RDF. However, the RDF 
pattern (actually, directed graph in terms of mathematics) is not 
adequate to the hyper-graph pattern accepted in HSN, since 
in HSN one and the same link can connect different objects 
simultaneously. In order to represent hyper-graphs, different 
semantic networks – such as WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), 
MultiNet (Helbig 2006), topic maps (Dong and Li 2004) or even 
simple Wiki-texts interconnected by so-called ‘categories’ – 
should be used. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned semantic 
networks do not provide proper tools to perform the tasks 
set by HSN. For this purpose, the experience acquired by 
designers of universal knowledge processing systems (e.g. 
SNePS, see Shapiro 2007, or Cyc, see Panton 2006) should be 
taken into consideration. 
One more important problem is linkage of different HSN, 
including Latgales Dati. Such linkage can be conducive to 
cooperation of researchers, since it ensures remote access 
to historical data and exchange of information and results of 
research work. It seems that Web-services technology can 
carry out this task. In this case, HSN should be registered in 
a certain UDDI-server. A user’s query activates interaction of 
a Web-server with numerous related Web-servers, which are 
supplied with HSN-module. As a result, a semantic network 
is being generated on the basis of fragments of different 
networks relevant to the initial query.
The principles of creation of HSN substantiated above are 
used in designing a new version of the knowledge-based 
information system Latgales Dati. As software environment 
a specialized Web application created at Petrozavodsk State 
University is applied (http://mf.karelia.ru/hsn).
