 Historical manuscripts and printed maps of the pre-cadastral1 
period show enormous differences in scale, precision and 
color. Less apparent are differences in reliability between maps, 
or between different parts of the same map. True, modern 
techniques in computer assisted cartography make it possible 
to measure very accurately such differences between maps 
and geographic space with very distinct levels of precision and 
accuracy. However differences in reliability between maps, or 
between different parts of the same map, are not only due to 
the accuracy measurement techniques, but also to their original 
function and context of (re-)use. Historical information about 
the original context of function and context of (re-)use can 
give us insight how to measure accuracy, how to choose the 
right points for geo-referencing and how to rectify digital maps. 
On the other hand computer assisted cartography enables 
us to trace and to visualize important information about 
mapmaking, especially when further historical evidence is 
missing, is hidden or is distorted, consciously or unconsciously. 
The proposed paper is embedded in the project: Paper and 
Virtual Cities, (subsidized by the Netherlands Organization for 
Scientifi c Research) that aims at developing methodologies 
that a) permit researchers to use historical maps and related 
sources more accurately in creating in digital maps and virtual 
reconstructions of cities and b) allow users to recognize 
better technical manipulations and distortions of truth used in 
the process of mapmaking.2
In this paper we present as one of the outcomes of this project 
a method that visualizes different levels of accuracy in and 
between designs and maps in relation to their original function 
to assess their quality for re-use today. This method is presented 
by analyzing different 17th century designs, manuscript and 
engraved maps of the city of Leiden, in particular of the land 
surveyor, mapmaker Jan Pietersz. Dou. The choice for Leiden 
and Dou is no coincidence.
One of the reasons behind differences the accuracy of maps is 
the enormous variety in methods and measures used in land 
surveying and mapmaking in the Low Countries.3 This variety 
was the result of differences in the private training and the

backgrounds of the surveyors, in the use of local measures 
and in the exam procedures that differed from province to 
province.4 These differences would last until the 19th Century. 
However, already by the end of the 16th Century we see in and 
around Leiden the fi rst signs of standardization in surveying 
techniques and the use of measures.5 First of all, the Rhineland 
rod (3.767 meter) the standard of the water-administration 
body around Leiden is used more and more, along local 
measures in the Low Countries and in Dutch expansion 
overseas. A second reason to look at Leiden in more detail is 
that in 1600 a practical training school in land surveying and 
fortifi cation would be founded in the buildings of its university, 
the so-called Duytsche Mathematique, that turned out to be 
very successful not only in the Low Countries, but also in 
other European countries. This not only contributed to the 
spread and reception of the Rhineland rod, but also to the 
dissemination of more standardized ways of land surveying 
and fortifi cation.6 The instructional material of the professors 
of this training school and the notes of their pupils are still 
preserved, which allows us to study the process of surveying 
and mapmaking in more detail. 
The reason to look into the work of Jan Pietersz. Dou is his 
enormous production of maps. Westra (1994) calculated that 
at least 1150 maps still exist.7 Of the object of our case study 
alone, the city of Leiden, Dou produced at least 120 maps 
between 1600 and 1635, ranging from property maps, designs 
for extensions of the city and studies for civil engineering 
works etc. We will focus on the maps that Dou made for the 
urban extension of the city of Leiden of 1611.  Sometimes 
these (partial) maps were made for a specifi c purpose; in other 
cases Dou tried in comprehensive maps, combining property 
estimates and future designs, to tackle problems of illegal 
economic activities, pollution, housing and fortifi cation. Since 
these measurements were taken in his offi cial role of, sworn-in 
land surveyor we can assume that they were supposed to be 
accurate. This variety in designs and maps for the same area 
allows us to discuss accuracy in relation to function and (re-
)use of maps. We will also explain that the differences between 
designs and maps require different methods of geo-referencing 
and analysis.
In particular, we will give attention to one design map of Dou 
for the northern part of the city of Leiden RAL PV 1002-
06 (Regionaal Archief Leiden) to show how misinterpretation 
of features lead to unreliable or biased decisions when the 
historical context is not taken into account, even when we 
can consider the results, in terms of accuracy, satisfactory. 
Since Dou later also made maps for commercial purposes 
of the same northern extension of Leiden it is interesting to 
compare these maps. 
Conclusions are drawn addressing the question of whether 
Dou used the same measurements to produce a commercial 
map or that he settled for less accuracy given the different 
purpose of the later map compared to his designs and 
property maps. To answer this question, we use modern digital 
techniques of geo-processing8 to compare the old maps to 
modern cartographical resources and to the cadastral map 
of the 1800s in order to determine how accurate the various 
maps in question are. We do this, by using the American 
National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA) to defi ne 
accuracy at a 95% confi dence level. By point-based analysis we 
link distributional errors to classifi ed features in order to fi nd 
a relationship between accuracy and map function.9
Notes
(1) Cadastral mapping refers to the “mapping of property 
boundaries, particularly to record the limitation of title or 
for the assessment of taxation”. The term “cadastral” is also 
used for referring to surveys and resurveys of public lands 
(Neumann, J. Encyclopedic Dictionary of Cartography in 25 
Languages 1.16, 1997).

used for scaling, rotating and translating the old map to give 
modern coordinates to it and allow further comparisons 
to modern sources. This algorithm is defi ned by a kind of
