Introduction
This paper presents the results of a study by the VERA project 
(Virtual Research Environment for Archaeology: http://vera.
rdg.ac.uk ) which aimed to investigate how archaeologists use 
information technology (IT) in the context of a fi eld excavation. 
This study was undertaken by researchers at School of Library, 
Archive and Information Studies, University College London, 
who collaborate on the project with the School of Systems 
Engineering, and the Department of Archaeology, University 
of Reading.
VERA is funded by the JISC Virtual Research Environments 
Programme, Phase 2, (http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/
programmes/vre2.aspx) and runs from April 2007 until March 
2009. We aim to produce a fully operational virtual research 
environment for the archaeological community. Our work is 
based on a research excavation of part of the large Roman town 
at Silchester, which aims to trace the site’s development from 
its origins before the Roman Conquest to its abandonment 
in the fi fth century A.D (Clarke et al 2007). This complex 
urban site provides the material to populate the research 
environment, utilising the Integrated Archaeological Data 
Base (IADB: http://www.iadb.co.uk/specialist/it.htm), an online 
database system for managing recording, analysis, archiving 
and online publication of archaeological fi nds, contexts and 
plans. The dig allows us to: study the use of advanced IT in 
an archaeological context; investigate the tasks carried out 
within archaeological excavations; ascertain how and where 
technology can be used to facilitate information fl ow within 
a dig; and inform the designers of the IADB how it may be 
adapted to allow integrated use of the tools in the trench 
itself.
Research Context
Although archaeologists were quick to embrace IT to aid in 
research analysis and outputs (Lafl in 1982, Ross et al 1990, 
Reilly and Rahtz 1992), and the use of IT is now central to

the manipulation and display of archaeological data (Lock 
and Brown 2000, McPherron and Dibble, 2002, Lock 2003) 
the use of IT to aid fi eld archaeology is in its relative infancy 
due to the physical characteristics of archaeological sites, and 
the diffi culties of using IT in the outdoor environment. Whilst 
the use of electronic surveying equipment (total stations, 
(Eiteljorg, 1994)) and digital cameras is now common place 
on archaeological sites there are relatively few archaeological 
organizations that use digital recording methods to replace the 
traditional paper records which rely on manual data input at 
a (sometimes much) later date. With ever increasing amounts 
of data being generated by excavations onsite databases are 
becoming increasingly necessary, for example at the excavations 
at Catalhoyuk in Turkey (http://www.catalhoyuk.com/database/
catal/) and the site of Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport (http://
www.framearch.co.uk/t5/), and some archaeologists have 
begun to use digital data input from total stations, PDAs, tablet 
PCs, digital cameras, digital callipers, digital pens and barcodes 
(McPherron and Dibble, 2003, Dibble et al., 2007). For many 
excavations, however, the use of IT is restricted to the analysis 
stage rather than fi eld recording. The aim of the VERA project 
is to investigate the use of IT within the context of a fi eld 
excavation and to ascertain if, and how, it may be appropriated 
to speed up the process of data recording, entry and access.
Method
We used a diary study to gather information about the work 
patterns of different archaeological roles and the way that they 
are supported by both digital and analogue technologies. The 
study was carried out by the UCL team, at the Silchester dig 
during the summer of 2007. (http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/
la/silchester/publish/fi eld/index.php) Researchers from 
Reading also carried out a study into the use of ICT hardware 
to support digging and data entry. A detailed record of the 
progress of both the dig and the study was kept on the VERA 
blog (http://vera.rdg.ac.uk/blog).
Diary studies enable researchers to understand how people 
usually work and can be used to identify areas that might 
be improved by the adoption of new working practices or 
technologies. (O’Hara et al. 1998). They have been used in the 
area of student use of IT, and to study the work of humanities 
scholars. (Rimmer et. al. Forthcoming) however, this is the 
fi rst use of this method to study fi eld archaeology that we 
are aware of.
During diary studies, participants are asked to keep a 
detailed record of their work over a short period of time. 
The participant records the activity that they are undertaking, 
what technologies they are using and any comments they 
have on problems or the progress of their work. This helps us 
to understand the patterns of behaviour that archaeologists 
exhibit, and how technology can support these behaviours.
We also obtained contextual data about participants using a 
simple questionnaire. This elicited information about the diary 
survey participants (role, team, status) and their experience 
of using the technology on site. A cross section of people 
representing different types of work and levels of experience 
were chosen. For example we included inexperienced and 
experienced excavators; members of the fi nds team, who 
process the discoveries made on site; those who produce 
plans of the site and visitor centre staff.
A defi ned area of the Silchester site was used to test the 
use of new technologies to support excavation. In this area 
archaeologists used digital pens and paper, (http://www.
logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/digital_pen/devices/
408&cl=us,en ) digital cameras, and Nokia N800 PDAs (http://
www.nokia.co.uk/A4305204). Diaries from this area were 
compared to those using traditional printed context sheets to 
record their work.
Findings
This paper will present the fi ndings from the study, covering 
various issues such as the attitude of archaeologists to diary 
studies, previous and present experiences of using technology 
on research excavations, the effect of familiarity of technology 
on uptake and use, and resistance and concerns regarding 
the use of technology within an archaeological dig. We also 
evaluate specifi c technologies for this purpose, such as the 
Nokia N800 PDA, and Logitech Digital Pens, and ascertain how 
IT can fi t into existing workfl ow models to aid archaeologists 
in tracking information alongside their very physical task.
Future work
This year’s diary study supplied us with much interesting data 
about the past, current and potential use of IT in the trench. 
We will repeat the study next year to gain more detailed data. 
Participants will be asked to focus on a shorter period of time, 
one or two days, as opposed to fi ve this year. Next year we 
will have a research assistant on site, allowing us to undertake 
interviews with participants, clarify entries, and build up a 
good working relationship with experts working on the 
excavation. Two periods of diary study will also be undertaken, 
allowing for analysis and refi ning methods between studies. 
This will also be juxtaposed with off-site user testing and 
analysis workshops of the IADB, to gain understanding of how 
archaeologists use technology both on and off site. We also 
plan to run an additional training session in the use of ICT 
hardware before the start of next year’s dig, in addition to the 
usual archaeological training.
Conclusion
The aim of this study is to feed back evidence of use of IT to 
the team developing the virtual environment interface of the 
IADB. It is hoped that by ascertaining and understanding user 
needs, being able to track and trace information workfl ow 
throughout the dig, and gaining an explicit understanding of 
the tasks undertaken by archaeologists that more intuitive

technologies can be adopted, and adapted, to meet the needs 
of archaeologists on site, and improve data fl ow within digs 
themselves.
