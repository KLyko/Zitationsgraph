As the amount of scholarly material published in digital form 
increases, there is growing pressure on content producers 
to identify the needs of expert readers and to create online 
tools that satisfy their requirements. Based on the results 
of a study conducted by the Public Knowledge Project and 
introduced at Digital Humanities 2006 (Siemens, Willinsky and 
Blake), continued and augmented since, this paper discusses 
the reactions of Humanities Computing scholars and graduate 
students to using a set of online reading tools.
Expert readers were asked about the value of using online 
tools that allowed them to check, readily, related studies that 
were not cited in the article; to examine work that has followed 
on the study reported in the article; to consider additional 
work that has been done by the same author; and to consult 
additional sources on the topic outside of the academic 
literature. In the course of this study, these domain-expert 
readers made it clear that reading tools could make a defi nite, 
if limited, contribution to their critical engagement with journal 
articles (especially if certain improvements were made). Their 
reactions also point to an existing set of sophisticated reading 
strategies common to most expert readers.
Our fi ndings indicate that online tools are of most value to 
expert readers when they complement and augment readers’ 
existing strategies. We have organized the results of the 
study around a number of themes that emerged during our 
interviews with domain expert readers as these themes speak 
to both readers’ existing reading processes and the potential 
value of the online reading tools. By entering user responses 
into a matrix, we have been able to measure user responses 
and track both negative and positive reactions to different 
aspects of the online reading tools.
In addition to these fi ndings, we also discovered that users’ 
experiences with the online reading tools was infl uenced by 
their existing research methods, their familiarity with online 
research, and their expectations of online publishing. While 
many respondents felt that the “information environment” 
created by the online tools was benefi cial to their evaluation 
and understanding of the material, they also expressed some 
dissatisfaction with their experience. Some users questioned 
the relevance and usefulness of the contextual material 
retrieved by the online tools. Users were also concerned with 
the perceived credibility of research published online and the 
limited amount of freely available online material.
The results of our study reveal both the potential strengths 
and perceived weaknesses of online reading environments. 
Understanding how users read and evaluate research materials, 
anticipating users’ expectations of the reading tools and 
resources, and addressing user concerns about the availability 
of online material will lead to improvements in the design and 
features of online publishing.
