In this paper, I argue that the later a given specimen of hexamater 
is, the less rhythmical it tends to be. A brief discussion of 
the background of ancient Greek and Latin metrics and its 
connections to orality is followed by an account of spectral 
density analysis as my chosen method. I then go on to comment 
on the experimental data obtained by representing several 
samples of ancient poetry as coded sequences of binary values. 
In the last section, I suggest how spectral density analysis may 
help to account for other features of ancient meter.
The ancient epic poems, especially the most archaic Greek 
poetry attributed to Homer, are usually referred as an 
extraordinary fact in the history of European literature. For 
present-day readers educated in a culture of writing, it seems 
unbelievable that such a large body of poetry should have 
been composed in a culture based on oral transmission. In 
fact, despite of genuine singers’ and audience’s memory, epic 
poems did not emerge at once as fi xed texts, but they were 
re-composed in each performance (Lord 2000, Foley 1993, 
Nagy 1996). The surviving ancient epic poetry displays some 
features that refl ect archaic techniques of oral composition, 
formulaic structure being probably the most characteristic 
(Parry 1971: 37-117).
Since formulaic diction prefers some fi xed rhythmical patterns 
(Parry 1971: 8-21), we can ask some questions about the role 
of both versifi cation and rhythm in oral composition. Why was 
all of ancient epic poetry, both Greek and Latin, composed 
in one particular type of meter called hexameter? Does the 
choice of meter infl uence the rhythmicity of a text? Why does 
hexameter, in spite of its relatively restricted possibilities of 
shaping rhythm, differ so much from one writer to another 
some (cf. Duckworth 1969: 37-87)? And, last but not least, 
what possible reasons are there for those wide differences 
between particular authors?
It is commonly known that poetry is in general easier to 
memorize than prose, because rhythm itself tends to facilitate 
memorization. In a culture without writing, memorization is 
crucial, and much depends on the quality of oral transmission. 
In epic poems from an oral culture rhythm is thus likely to 
be particularly important for both singers and hearers, even 
though they need not consciously perceive poetic texts as 
rhythmical to benefi t from rhythm as an aid to memory.

It may then be expected on theoretical grounds that non-oral 
poems, such as the Latin epic poetry or the Greek hexameter 
of the Alexandrian age, will be largely non-rhythmical, or at 
least display weaker rhythm effects than the archaic poems 
of Homer and Hesiod. Although formulaic diction and other 
techniques of oral composition are noticeable mostly in 
Homer’s epics (Parry 1971, Lord 2000, Foley 1993, etc.), the 
later hexameters, both Greek and Latin, also display some 
features of oral diction (Parry 1971: 24-36). The metrical 
structure of hexameter might be quite similar: strongly 
rhythmical in the oldest (or rather, the most archaic) epic 
poems, and less conspicuous in poems composed in written 
form a few centuries after Homer. The aim of the present 
study is to test the hypothesis that the later a given specimen 
of hexameter is, the less rhythmical it tends to be.
Because of its nature versifi cation easily lends itself to statistical 
analysis. A great deal of work has already been done in this 
fi eld, including studies of Greek and Latin hexameter (Jones 
& Gray 1972, Duckworth 1969, Foley 1993, etc.). However, 
the main disadvantage of the methods applied in existing 
research is that they describe a given meter as if it were a set 
of independent elements, which is actually not true. In each 
versifi cation system, the specifi c sequence of elements plays 
a far more important role in establishing a particular type of 
rhythm than the relations between those elements regardless 
their linear order (language “in the mass” vs. language “in the 
line”; cf. Pawlowski 1999).
Fortunately, there are a few methods of statistical analysis 
(both numeric and probabilistic) that study verse by means 
of an ordered sequence of elements. These methods include, 
for example, time series modeling, Fourier analysis, the theory 
of Markov chains and Shannon’s theory of information. In the 
present study, spectral density analysis was used (Gottman 
1999, Priestley 1981, etc.). Spectral analysis seems to be a very 
suitable tool because it provides a cross-section of a given 
time series: it allows us to detect waves, regularities and cycles 
which are not otherwise manifest and open to inspection. In 
the case of a coded poetry sample, the spectrogram shows 
not only simple repetitions of metrical patterns, but also 
some subtle rhythmical relations, if any, between distant lines 
or stanzas. On a given spectrogram, a distinguishable peak 
indicates the existence of a rhythmical wave; numerous peaks 
suggest a quite complicated rhythm, while a pure noise (no 
peaks) on the spectrogram refl ects a non-rhythmical data.
To verify the hypothesis of hexameter’s decreasing rhythmicity, 
7 samples of Greek and 3 samples of Latin epic poetry were 
chosen. The specifi c selection of sample material was as 
follows: 3 samples from Homeric hexameter (books 18 and 
22 from the Iliad, book 3 from the Odyssey), 1 sample from 
Hesiod (Theogony), Apollonius (Argonautica, book 1), Aratos 
(Phainomena), Nonnos (Dionysiaca, book 1), Vergil (Aeneid, 
book 3), Horace (Ars poetica), and Ovid (Metamorphoses, 
book 1). In each sample, the fi rst 500 lines were coded in 
such a way that each long syllable was assigned value 1, and 
each short syllable value 0. Though it is disputed whether 
ancient verse was purely quantitative or whether it also 
had some prosodic features (Pawlowski & Eder 2001), the 
quantity-based nature of Greek and Roman meter was never 
questioned. It is probable that rhythm was generated not only 
by quantity (especially in live performances), but it is certain 
that quantity itself played an essential role in ancient meter. 
Thus, in the coding procedure, all prosodic features were left 
out except the quantity of syllables (cf. Jones & Gray 1972, 
Duckworth 1969, Foley 1993, etc.). A binary-coded series was 
then obtained for each sample, e.g., book 22 of the Iliad begins 
as a series of values:
1110010010010011100100100100111001110010010011...
The coded samples were analyzed by means of the spectral 
density function. As might be expected, on each spectrogram 
there appeared a few peaks indicating the existence of several 
rhythmical waves in the data. However, while the peaks 
suggesting the existence of 2- and 3-syllable patterns it the text 
were very similar for all the spectrograms and quite obvious, 
the other peaks showed some large differences between the 
samples. Perhaps the most surprising was the peak echoing 
the wave with a 16-syllable period, which could be found in the 
samples of early Greek poems by Homer, Hesiod, Apollonius, 
and Aratos (cf. Fig. 1). The same peak was far less noticeable in 
the late Greek hexameter of Nonnos, and almost absent in the 
samples of Latin writers (cf. Fig. 2). Other differences between 
the spectrograms have corroborated the observation: the 
rhythmical effects of the late poems were, in general, weaker 
as compared with the rich rhythmical structure of the earliest, 
orally composed epic poems.
Although the main hypothesis has been verifi ed, the results also 
showed some peculiarities. For example, the archaic poems by 
Homer and Hesiod did not differ signifi cantly from the poems 
of the Alexandrian age (Apollonius, Aratos), which was rather 
unexpected. Again, the rhythm of the Latin hexameter turned 
out to have a different underlying structure than that of all the 
Greek samples. There are some possible explanations of those 
facts, such as that the weaker rhythm of the Latin samples 
may relate to inherent differences between Latin and Greek. 
More research, both in statistics and in philology, is needed, 
however, to make such explanations more nuanced and more 
persuasive.
