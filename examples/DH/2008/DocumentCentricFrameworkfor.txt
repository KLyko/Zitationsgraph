Electronic text projects range in complexity from simple 
collections of page images to bundles of page images and 
transcribed text from multiple versions or editions (Haarhoff, 
Porter). To facilitate navigation within texts and across texts, 
an increasing number of digital initiatives, such as the Princeton 
University Library Digital Collections (http://diglib.princeton.
edu/) and the Oxford Digital Library (http://www.odl.ox.ac.
uk/), and cultural heritage organizations, such as the Culturenet 
Cymru (http://www.culturenetcymru.com) and the Library 
of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/index.html), are relying on 
the complementary strengths of open standards such as the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and the Metadata Encoding and 
Transmission Standard (METS) for describing, representing, 
and delivering texts online.
The core purpose of METS is to record, in a machine-readable 
form, the metadata and structure of a digital object, including 
fi les that comprise or are related to the object itself. As such, 
the standard is a useful tool for managing and preserving 
digital library and humanities resources (Cantara; Semple). 
According to Morgan Cundiff, Senior Standards Specialist for 
the Library of Congress, the maintenance organization for the 
METS standard:
METS is an XML schema designed for the purpose of 
creating XML document instances that express the 
hierarchical structure of digital library objects, the names 
and locations of the fi les that comprise those digital objects, 
and the associated descriptive and administrative metadata. 
(53)
Similarly, the TEI standard was developed to capture both 
semantic (e.g., metadata) and syntactic (e.g., structural 
characteristics) features of a document in machine-readable 
form that promotes interoperability, searchability and textual 
analysis. According to the Text Encoding Initiative web site, the 
TEI standard is defi ned thusly:

The TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange 
defi ne and document a markup language for representing 
the structural, renditional, and conceptual features of texts. 
They focus (though not exclusively) on the encoding of 
documents in the humanities and social sciences, and in 
particular on the representation of primary source materials 
for research and analysis. These guidelines are expressed 
as a modular, extensible XML schema, accompanied by 
detailed documentation, and are published under an open-
source license. (“TEI Guidelines”)
METS, as its name suggests, is focused more exclusively on 
metadata. While digital objects—such as a text, image, or 
video—may be embedded within a METS document, METS 
does not provide guidelines, elements and attributes for 
representing the digital object itself; rather, the aim of METS is 
to describe metadata about a digital object and the relationships 
among an object’s constituent parts. In sum, METS is data-
centric; TEI is document-centric.
In April 2006, the Indiana University Digital Library 
Program released a beta version of METS Navigator (http://
metsnavigator.sourceforge.net/), a METS-based, open source 
software solution for the discovery and display of multi-part 
digital objects. Using the information in the METS structural 
map elements, METS Navigator builds a hierarchical menu that 
allows users to navigate to specifi c sections of a document, 
such as title page, specifi c chapters, illustrations, etc. for a 
book. METS Navigator also allows simple navigation to the 
next, previous, fi rst, and last page image or component parts 
of a digital object. METS Navigator can also make use of the 
descriptive metadata in the METS document to populate the 
interface with bibliographic and descriptive information about 
the digital object. METS Navigator was initially developed at 
Indiana University (IU) for the online display and navigation 
of brittle books digitized by the IU Libraries’ E. Lingle Craig 
Preservation Laboratory. However, realizing the need for 
such a tool across a wide range of digital library projects and 
applications, we designed the system to be generalizable and 
confi gurable. To assist with the use of METS Navigator for new 
projects, a METS profi le, also expressed in XML, is registered 
with the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/standards/
mets/profi les/00000014.html). The profi le provides detailed 
documentation about the structure of the METS documents 
required by the METS Navigator application.
Cantara reported in her brief article, “The Text-Encoding 
Initiative: Part 2,” that discussion of the relationship between 
the TEI and METS was a primary focus during the Fourth 
Annual TEI Consortium Members’ Meeting held in 2004 at 
Johns Hopkins University (110). The relationship between 
the standards was also a topic of discussion during the 
2007 Members’ Meeting, and was specifi cally raised in Fotis 
Jannidis’ plenary entitled “TEI in a Crystal Ball.” Despite 
these discussions, the community is still lacking a well-
documented workfl ow for the derivation of METS documents 
from authoritative TEI fi les. We believe the TEI, if properly 
structured, can be used as the “master” source of information 
from which a full METS document can be automatically 
generated, facilitating the display of text collections in METS 
Navigator. The TEI, much like METS, provides a rich vocabulary 
and framework for encoding descriptive and structural 
metadata for a variety of documents. The descriptive metadata 
typically found in the TEI Header may be used to populate the 
corresponding components (descriptive metadata section) of 
a METS document. The embedded structural metadata that 
describe divisions, sections, headings and page breaks in a 
TEI document may be used to generate the structural map 
section of a METS document. Unlike the TEI, the METS scheme 
has explicit mechanisms in place for expressing relationships 
between multiple representations of the digital content such 
as encoded text fi les and page images. By integrating the TEI-
METS workfl ow into METS Navigator, scholars and digital 
library and humanities programs can more easily implement 
online text collections. Further, the intersection between TEI 
and METS documents can provide the foundation for enhanced 
end-user exploration of electronic texts.
The IU Digital Library Program as a result of enhancing the 
functionality and modularity of the METS Navigator software 
is also in the process of formalizing and integrating the TEI-
METS workfl ow in support of online page turning. Our paper 
will trace the development of METS Navigator including the 
TEI-METS workfl ow, demonstrate the METS Navigator system 
using TEI-cum-METS documents, review METS Navigator 
confi guration options, detail fi ndings from recent user studies, 
and outline plans for current and future development of the 
METS Navigator.
