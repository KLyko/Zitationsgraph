Text collation is a vital aspect of textual editing; its results 
feature prominently in scholarly editions, either in printed 
or electronic form. The Centre for Scholarly Editing and 
Document Studies (CTB) of the Flemish Royal Academy 
for Dutch Language and Literature has a strong research 
interest in electronic textual editing. Much of the research for 
the electronic editions of  De teleurgang van den Waterhoek 
(2000) and  De trein der traagheid (forthcoming) concerned 
appropriate ways of visualising textual traditions. Starting from 
the functionality of collation results in electronic editions, as 
illustrated in the latter edition, this paper will investigate the 
needs for a dedicated automatic text collation tool for text-
critical research purposes.
The second section sets out with identifying different scenarios 
in the production model of electronic scholarly editions (based 
on Ott, 1992; Vanhoutte, 2006). Consequently, possible criteria 
for an automatic text collation tool in these production 
scenarios are identifi ed, both on a collation-internal and 
generic software level. These criteria are analysed both from 
the broader perspective of automatic differencing algorithms 
and tools that have been developed for purposes of automatic 
version management in software development (Mouat, 2002; 
Komvoteas, 2003; Cobéna, 2003; Cobéna e.a., 2002 and [2004]; 
Peters, 2005; Trieloff, 2006), and from the specifi c perspective 
of text encoding and collation for academic purposes (Kegel 
and Van Elsacker, 2007; Robinson, 2007). Collation-internal 
criteria distinguish between three phases of the collation 
process: the automatic text comparison itself, representation 
of these comparisons and aspects of visualisation. Especially 
in the context of electronic scholarly editions, for which TEI 
XML is the de facto encoding standard, a degree of XML-
awareness can be considered a minimal requirement for 
collation algorithms. A dedicated collation algorithm would 
be able to track changes on a structural and on word level. 
Moreover, since textual editing typically deals with complex 
text traditions, the ability to compare more than two versions 
of a text could be another requirement for a collation 
algorithm. Regarding representation of the collation results, 
an XML perspective is preferable as well. This allows for easier 
integration of the collation step with other steps in electronic 
editing. In a maximal scenario, a dedicated text collation tool 
would represent the collation results immediately in one or 
other TEI fl avour for encoding textual variation. Visualisation 
of the collation results could be considered a criterion for a 
text collation tool, but seems less vital, however prominent it

features in the broader context of developing an electronic 
edition. From a generic software perspective, a dedicated tool 
would be open source, free, multi-platform, and embeddable in 
other applications. These criteria are summarised in a minimal 
and a maximal scenario. The plea for a tool that meets the 
criteria for a minimal scenario is illustrated in the third section 
of the paper.
The third section of the paper is a case study of another 
electronic edition in preparation at the CTB: the complete 
works of the 16th century Flemish poetess Anna Bijns, 
totalling around 300 poems that come in about 60 variant 
pairs or triplets. The specifi c circumstances of this project led 
to an investigation for collation solutions in parallel with the 
transcription and markup of the texts. After an evaluation of 
some interesting candidate tools for the collation step, the 
choice was made eventually to investigate how a generic 
XML-aware comparison tool could be put to use for multiple 
text collations in the context of textual editing. Besides 
formal procedures and a set of XSLT stylesheets for different 
processing stages of the collation results, this development 
process provided an interesting insight in the specifi c nature 
of ‘textual’ text collation, and the role of the editor. The 
description of the experimental approach that was taken will 
illustrate the criteria sketched out in the previous section, 
indicate what is possible already with quite generic tools, and 
point out the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.
Finally, the fi ndings are summarised and a plea is made for a text 
collation tool that fi lls the current lacunae with regards to the 
current tools’ capacities for the distinct steps of comparison, 
representation and visualisation.
