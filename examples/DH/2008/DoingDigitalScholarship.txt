Doing Digital Scholarship

When I completed my dissertation Bachelors of Arts: 
Bachelorhood and the Construction of Literary Identity in Antebellum 
America in 2002, I fi gured that I was ahead of most of my peers 
in my use of digital resources, but I made no pretense of 
doing digital scholarship. I plumbed electronic text collections 
such as Making of America and Early American Fiction for 
references to bachelorhood, and I used simple text analysis 
tools to count the number of times words such as “bachelor” 
appeared in key texts. I even built an online critical edition 
of a section from Reveries of a Bachelor (http://etext.virginia.
edu/users/spiro/Contents2.html), one of the central texts of 
sentimental bachelorhood. But in my determination to fi nish 
my PhD before gathering too many more gray hairs, I resisted 
the impulse to use more sophisticated analytical tools or to 
publish my dissertation online.
Five years later, the possibilities for digital scholarship in the 
humanities have grown. Projects such as TAPOR, Token-X, and 
MONK are constructing sophisticated tools for text analysis 
and visualization. Massive text digitization projects such as 
Google Books and the Open Content Alliance are making 
it possible to search thousands (if not millions) of books. 
NINES and other initiatives are building communities of digital 
humanities scholars, portals to content, and mechanisms for 
conducting peer review of digital scholarship. To encourage 
digital scholarship, the NEH recently launched a funding 
program. Meanwhile, scholars are blogging, putting up videos 
on YouTube, and using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate.
Despite this growth in digital scholarship, there are still too 
few examples of innovative projects that employ “digital 
collections and analytical tools to generate new intellectual 
products” (ACLS 7). As reports such as A Kaleidoscope of 
American Literature and Our Cultural Commonwealth suggest, 
the paucity of digital scholarship results from the lack of 
appropriate tools, technical skills, funding, and recognition. In a 
study of Dickinson, Whitman and Uncle Tom’s Cabin scholars, 
my colleague Jane Segal and I found that although scholars 
are increasingly using digital resources in their research, they 
are essentially employing them to make traditional research 
practices more effi cient and gain access to more resources, 
not (yet) to transform their research methodology by 
employing new tools and processes (http://library.rice.edu/
services/digital_media_center/projects/the-impact-of-digital-
resources-on-humanities-research). What does it mean to do 
humanities research in a Web 2.0 world? To what extent do 
existing tools, resources, and research methods support digital 
scholarship, and what else do scholars need?

To investigate these questions, I am revisiting my dissertation 
to re-imagine and re-mix it as digital scholarship. I aim not only 
to open up new insights into my primary research area--the 
signifi cance of bachelorhood in nineteenth-century American 
culture--but also to document and analyze emerging methods 
for conducting research in the digital environment.  To what 
extent do digital tools and resources enable new approaches 
to traditional research questions—and to what extent are 
entirely new research questions and methods enabled?  I am 
structuring my research around what John Unsworth calls 
the “scholarly primitives,” or core research practices in the 
humanities:
1. Discovering: To determine how much information 
is available online, I have searched for the nearly 300 
resources cited in my dissertation in Google Books, Making 
of America, and other web sites. I found that 77% of my 
primary source resources and 22% of my secondary sources 
are available online as full-text, while 92% of all my research 
materials have been digitized (this number includes works 
available through Google Books as limited preview, snippet 
view, and no preview.)  Although most nineteenth-century 
books cited in my dissertation are now freely available 
online, many archival resources and periodicals have not yet 
been digitized. 
2. Annotating: In the past, I kept research notes in long, 
unwieldy Word documents, which made it hard to fi nd 
information that I needed. New software such as Zotero 
enables researchers to store copies of the digital resources 
and to make annotations as part of the metadata record. 
What effect does the ability to share and annotate 
resources have on research practices? How useful is tagging 
as a mechanism for organizing information?  
3. Comparing: Through text analysis and collation software 
such as Juxta and TAPOR, scholars can compare different 
versions of texts and detect patterns. Likewise, the Virtual 
Lightbox allows researchers to compare and manipulate 
digital images. What kind of new insights can be generated 
by using these tools? In the course of doing my research, 
I am testing freely available tools and evaluating their 
usefulness for my project.
4. Referring: With digital publications, we not only can refer 
to prior work, but link to it, even embed it. What is the 
best means for constructing a scholarly apparatus in digital 
scholarship, particularly in a work focused not only on 
making an argument, but also on examining the process that 
shaped that argument? 
5. Sampling: With so much information available, what 
criteria should we use to determine what to focus on? 
Since not everything is digitized and search engines can be 
blunt instruments, what do we ignore by relying mainly on 
digital resources? In my blog, I am refl ecting on the selection 
criteria used to produce the arguments in my revamped 
dissertation.
6. Illustrating: What kind of evidence do we use to build 
an argument in a work of digital scholarship, and how is that 
evidence presented? In my dissertation, I generalized about 
the signifi cance of bachelorhood in American literature by 
performing close readings of a few key texts, but such a 
method was admittedly unsystematic. By using text analysis 
tools to study a much larger sample of primary texts, I 
can cite statistics such as word frequency in making my 
argument--but does this make my argument any more 
convincing?
7. Representing: How should a work of digital scholarship 
be presented? Ideally readers would be able to examine 
the evidence for themselves and even perform their 
own queries. At the same time, information should be 
offered so that it is clear and consistent with familiar 
academic discourse. How should I make available not 
only research conclusions, but also the detailed research 
process that undergirds these conclusions--the successful 
and unsuccessful searches, the queries run in text analysis 
software, the insights offered by collaborators? How will 
the digital work compare to the more traditional original 
dissertation? What kind of tools (for instance, ifBook’s 
Sophie) will be used to author the work?
In addition to Unsworth’s list, I offer two more:
8. Collaborating: Although humanities scholars are thought 
to be solitary, they collaborate frequently by exchanging 
bibliographic references and drafts of their essays. How do 
I engage the community in my research? I am encouraging 
others to comment on my (re-) work in progress (http://
digitalhumanities.edublogs.org/) using Comment Press. 
Moreover, I am bookmarking all web-based sources for 
my study on delicious (http://del.icio.us/lms4w/digital_
scholarship) and making available feeds from my various 
research sources through a PageFlakes portal (http://www.
pagefl akes.com/lspiro/). On my blog, “Digital Scholarship 
in the Humanities,” I explore issues and ideas raised by 
my research (http://digitalscholarship.wordpress.com/).  I 
am examining what it takes to build an audience and how 
visibility and collaboration affect my research practices.
9. Remixing: What would it mean to take an earlier 
work--my own dissertation, for example--use new sources 
and approaches, and present it in a new form? What 
constitutes a scholarly remix, and what are the implications 
for intellectual property and academic ethics? I also plan 
to experiment with mashups as a means of generating and 
presenting new insights, such as a Google Map plotting 
census statistics about antebellum bachelors or a visual 
mashup of images of bachelors.
This project examines the process of doing research digitally, 
the capabilities and limits of existing tools and resources, and 
the best means of authoring, representing and disseminating 
digital scholarship. I aim to make this process as open, visible, 
and collaborative as possible.  My presentation will focus

on emerging research methodologies in the humanities, 
particularly the use of tools to analyze and organize 
information, the development of protocols for searching and 
selecting resources, and the dissemination of ideas through 
blogs and multimedia publication.
