Introduction
The focus of this paper is on Wmatrix (Rayson 2008), and 
how the output from this relatively new corpus tool is proving 
useful in connecting language patterns that occur in Talking It 
Over - a novel by Julian Barnes - with impressions of narrators 
and characters. My PhD research is concerned with: 1) the 
role of the narrator and author in characterisation in prose 
fi ction, in particular how the narrator intervenes and guides 
our perception of character – something that, in my opinion, 
has not been satisfactorily dealt with in existing literature; and 
2) how corpus tools can be usefully employed in this type of 
investigation. In this paper I will show that Wmatrix helps to 
highlight parts of the novel that are important insofar as theme 
and/or narratorial style and/or characterisation. I will go on to 
discuss diffi culties I encountered during my investigation, and 
possible developments to Wmatrix that could be benefi cial to 
future researchers.
Of course, computer-assisted approaches to the critical 
analyses of novels are no longer completely new, and corpus 
stylistics (as it is sometimes known) is a steadily growing area of 
interest. Indeed, corpus approaches have already been used to 
investigate character in prose and drama. McKenna and Antonia 
(1996), for example, compare the internal monologues of three 
characters (Molly, Stephen and Leopold) in Joyce’s Ulysses, 
testing the signifi cance on the most frequent words in word-
lists for each character, and showing that common word usage 
can form “[…] distinct idioms that characterize the interior 
monologues […]” (McKenna and Antonia 1996:65). Also, 
more recently, Culpeper (2002) uses the ‘KeyWord’ facility 
in WordSmith Tools (Scott 1996) to demonstrate how the 
analysis of characters’ keywords in Shakespeare’s Romeo and 
Juliet can provide data to help establish lexical and grammatical 
patterns for a number of the main characters in the play.
While my research adopts similar approaches to the two 
examples above, it takes a small yet useful step beyond word-
level analysis, focussing instead on semantic analysis and key-
concepts. This is possible because Wmatrix can analyse a text 
at the semantic level (see below). 
Wmatrix
Wmatrix (Rayson 2008) is a web-based environment that 
contains a number of tools for the analyses of texts. Plain-text 
versions of texts can be uploaded to the Wmatrix web-server 
where they are automatically processed in three different 
ways: 
1) Word level – frequency lists of all the words in a text are 
compiled and can be presented either in order of frequency 
or alphabetically;
2) Grammatical level – using the Constituent Likelihood 
Automatic Word-tagging System (CLAWS – see Garside 
1987, 1996; Leech, Garside and Bryant 1994; and Garside 
and Smith 1997) developed by the University Centre for 
Computer Corpus Research on Language (UCRELi) at 
Lancaster University, every word in a text is assigned a 
tag denoting the part-of-speech (POS) or grammatical 
category to which the word belongs. The words are then 
presented in list form either alphabetically (by POS tag) or 
by frequency (the most frequent POS tags at the top of the 
list);
3) Semantic level – every word is semantically tagged using 
the UCREL semantic analysis system (USASii) and then listed 
in order of frequency or alphabetically by semantic tag. 
USAS groups words together that are conceptually related. 
It assigns tags to each word using a hierarchical framework 
of categorization, which was originally based on MacArthur’s 
(1981) Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English. Tags consist 
of an uppercase letter, which indicates the general discourse 
fi eld, of which there are 21 – see Table 1.
Table 1 The 21 top level categories of the USAS tagset
A -
general & 
abstract terms
B -
the body & 
the individual
C -
arts & crafts
E -
emotion
F -

G -

H -

The uppercase letter is followed by a digit, which indicates 
the fi rst sub-division of that fi eld. The tag may also include a 
decimal point followed by a further digit to indicate fi ner sub-
division of the fi eld. For example, the major semantic fi eld of 
GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC DOMAIN is designated by the letter 
G. This major fi eld has three subdivisions: GOVERNMENT, POLITICS 
AND ELECTIONS – tagged G1; CRIME, LAW AND ORDER – tagged 
G2; and WARFARE, DEFENCE AND THE ARMY – tagged G3. The fi rst 
subdivision (G1 - GOVERNMENT, POLITICS AND ELECTIONS) is further 
divided into: GOVERNMENT ETC. – which is has the tag G1.1; and 
POLITICS – which is tagged G1.2.

From these initial lists, further analyses and comparisons are 
possible within the Wmatrix environment. However, the focus 
of this paper will be on my analysis of the USAS (semantic) 
output from Wmatrix, as this output proves to be the most 
interesting and the most useful interpretatively.
Data
Talking It Over, by Julian Barnes, is a story with a fairly familiar 
theme – a love triangle – that is told in a fairly unusual way 
– there are nine fi rst person narrators. This offers interesting 
data with regard to the interaction between character and 
narrator, as the story is told from a number of different 
perspectives, with the different narrators often commenting 
on the same events from different angles. Of the nine narrators 
Oliver, Stuart and Gillian are the three main ones, not only 
because they are the three people involved in the love triangle, 
but also because they say substantially more than any of the 
other narrators in the novel. The six other narrators are 
people whose involvement in the story is more peripheral, but 
come into contact with one or more of the main narrators. 
Within the novel each contribution by different narrators is 
signalled by the narrator’s name appearing in bold-type at the 
beginning of the narration. Some chapters consist of just one 
contribution from one narrator while others consist of several 
“narrations”. The three main narrators make contributions of 
varying lengths throughout the novel.
Approach
The exploration of narrators described in this paper adopts 
a similar approach to that used by Culpeper (2002) in his 
analysis of characters in Romeo and Juliet. That is, I compare 
the words of one narrator with the words of all the other 
narrators combined, using Wmatrix in its capacity as a tool 
for text comparison. This comparison produced a number of 
lists ranked by statistical signifi cance. The measure of statistical 
signifi cance used by Wmatrix is log-likelihood (LL).
The process of comparison involved, to some extent, 
disassembling the novel, in order to extract, into separate text 
fi les, the narrated words of each of the three main narrators. 
The disassembly process had to take into account the fact 
that within the different narrations there were the words of 
other people and characters. That is to say, the narrations 
contained speech, writing and thought presentation (SW&TP). 
This needed to be accounted for in the analysis in order to 
be as precise as possible about descriptions and impressions 
of narrators based on the Wmatrix output. The best way to 
achieve this was to produce a tagged version of the novel, 
from which relevant portions could be extracted more exactly 
using computer-tools. These extracted portions could then be 
analysed using Wmatrix. 
My paper will discuss the tagging process, the Wmatrix output 
and the subsequent analysis and show how key semantic 
concepts highlighted for each of the three main characters 
draw attention to important themes within the narrations, and 
to styles of narration which can then be linked to character 
traits. Included in my discussion will be issues concerning 
Wmatrix’s lexicon and the type of automated semantic analysis 
Wmatrix carries out.
Conclusions
Interpretative conclusions
The list of semantic groups produced by Wmatrix for each 
of the three main narrators show a number of differences 
in narrator characteristics and narratorial styles. Stuart’s list 
contains semantic groups that relate to his job. An investigation 
of highly signifi cant categories in the list showed that Stuart’s 
attitude relating to particular themes or concepts change 
during the novel. For example, Stuart’s relationship with money 
alters, which is refl ected in a change of attitude toward love. 
Stuart also becomes less worried about disappointing people 
and more concerned about not being disappointed himself.
An investigation of items in Gillian’s list of semantic categories 
identifi ed a more conversational style to her narration 
when compared to the rest of the narrators, as well as a 
determination to give an account of the story that was 
accurate and complete. 
The top item in Oliver’s list of categories contains the words 
that Wmatrix could not match. While on one hand this could 
be seen as a short-coming of Wmatrix, in the case of this study, 
the result gave a clear indication of the number of unusual, 
foreign and hyphenated words Oliver uses, and showed that 
he has very broad vocabulary as well as knowledge of a wide 
variety of topics. The list of unmatched words also highlighted 
Oliver’s creativity with language, and that creativity is very 
much part of his style. He uses unusual, technical and poetic 
words in place of more commonplace synonyms and this 
could be seen as evidence towards Oliver being showy and 
fl amboyant.
Wmatrix development
The results from this study, in particular those relating to 
Oliver’s narration and the failure of Wmatrix to successfully 
categorise many of the words used in it, raise issues regarding 
the tool’s lexicon and the semantic categories it uses. 
These issues will be discussed as potential avenues for the 
development of this useful corpus tool. For instance, the 
Wmatrix-lexicon is currently progressively updated and 
expanded, meaning that, in practice, there is no one static point 
from which comparisons of texts can be made. While there 
is a case for a lexicon that is as comprehensive as possible, 
the present way of managing the lexicon can cause diffi culties 
for research projects that continue over an extended period 
of time. However, creating a ‘standard’ fi xed lexicon is not 
without diffi culties and raises questions about what counts as 
‘standard’. Even though Wmatrix allows users to defi ne their 
own lexicon, a possible way forward might be to have multiple

lexicons, such as a scientifi c lexicon or a learner-English 
lexicon, which researchers could select depending on their 
research needs.
