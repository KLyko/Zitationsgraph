The Middle English Grammar Project
The Middle English Grammar Project (MEG), shared by the 
Universities of Glasgow and Stavanger, is working towards 
the description of Middle English orthography, morphology 
and phonology. MEG is among the fi rst attempts to span the 
gap between Jordan’s Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik: 
Lautlehre (1925) and now. Our aim is to combine the advances 
in Middle English dialectology in the latter half of the 20th 
century and the computing power currently available in the 
service of writing an up-to-date grammar of Middle English.
Middle English dialects and 
dialectology
The study of Middle English dialects took a giant leap 
forward by Angus McIntosh’s insight that Middle English texts 
represent distinct regional varieties in their spelling systems, 
and therefore the spelling variants of these texts could be 
studied in their own right and not merely as refl ections of 
the then speech systems, i.e. dialects (McIntosh 1963). This 
multitude of regional spellings arose when English had been 
replaced by French and Latin in all important aspects for 
nearly two centuries after the Norman Conquest: the re-
introduction of English into literary and utilitarian registers 
from the thirteenth century onwards was not governed by any 
nationwide standard and thus English was written according 
to each scribe’s perception of the ‘correct’ spelling. McIntosh’s 
vision led to a project that grew into A Linguistic Atlas of Late 
Mediaeval English (LALME; 1986).
Aims of MEG
The Middle English Grammar project builds on the work of 
the LALME team and aims at producing a description of Middle 
English orthography, phonology and morphology, from 1100 to 
1500. Here we use the term grammar in a wide, philological 
sense. Eventually, the grammar is meant as an replacement 
to Richard Jordan’s Handbuch der mittelenglischen Grammatik: 
Lautlehre, and to provide a reference point for the students and 
scholars of Middle English in the form of a broad description 
of the Middle English usages accompanied by more specifi c 
county studies, and eventually also all the base material we 
accumulate for this task (Black, Horobin, and Smith 2002: 13).

The Middle English Grammar: How?
The fi rst task of MEG is to compile a corpus of Middle English 
texts localized in LALME. The corpus is called The Middle 
English Grammar Corpus, or MEG-C (the fi rst installment 
forthcoming 2007). Secondly, the corpus texts need appropriate 
lemmatization and annotation in order to be usable in the 
course of MEG.
Linguistic data is collected by transcribing extracts from either 
the original manuscripts, or good-quality microfi lms. The 
prioritised material are the texts that were localized in LALME, 
although later texts that were not analysed for LALME will be 
taken into account as well. LALME covers years 1350-1450 
(-1500); the material for the studies in 1100-1350 will be 
drawn from A Linguistic Atlas for Early Middle English (LAEME) 
(Laing and Lass, forthcoming 2007).
The manuscript texts are represented by 3,000-word extracts 
(or in toto, if shorter), which should be suffi ciently for studies 
on orthography, phonology and morphology. The planned 
corpus will sample c. 1,000 texts, therefore the projected size 
of the corpus is 2.5-3 M words.
The conventions of transcription have been derived from 
those of the LAEME and A Linguistic Atlas of Older Scots projects 
(LAOS), with certain modifi cations. The most important 
questions that have been addressed during the transcription 
process have been whether to emphasise fi delity to the 
original vs. wieldy transcripts, and should the transcripts offer 
an interpretative reading of the manuscript text rather than 
the scribe’s actual pen strokes. According to the principles 
chosen, the transcriptions attempt to capture the graphemic 
and broad graphetic details, but not necessarily each detail on 
the level of individual handwriting (Black, Horobin, and Smith 
2002: 11).
MEG-C: lemmatization, annotation, 
publication
The second practical task is to lemmatize and to annotate the 
Corpus. Previous historical English corpora (Helsinki Corpus, 
Middle English Medical Texts) show the limitations the lack of 
lemmas set to the corpus user when tackling the variety of 
spellings attested to by Middle English texts. The lemmas in 
MEG-C will have an Oxford English Dictionary headword. There 
will also be another cue in the source language (the direct 
source languge before Middle English, usually Old English, 
French/Anglo-Norman or Latin). These two reference points 
on either side of Middle English will provide the user the means 
to search for occurrences of a lexical item even when the full 
range of spelling variation in Middle English is not known.
As regards the annotation of words of a text, they are divided 
into bound morphemes and other spelling units (this system 
is partly derived from Venezky (1970)). Each word is divided 
into a word initial sequence containing Onset and Nucleus, 
and they are followed by a series of Consonantal and Vowel 
Spelling Units. Each spelling unit is also given the equivalents in 
the source language and in Present Day English, thus enabling 
the search for e.g. all the ME refl exes of OE [a:] or or the 
spelling variants in Middle English that correspond to Present 
Day English word initial spelling sh-.
For the task of annotation and lemmatization the corpus is 
rendered into a relational database. The database plan has 
tables for different extralinguistic information, and the actual 
texts will be entered word by word, i.e. in the table for corpus 
texts, there will be one record for each word. The annotation 
plan we are intending to carry out should result in a corpus 
where one can search for any combination of extralinguistic 
factors and spelling units with reference points embedded in 
the actual Middle English texts and also in the source language 
and PDE spelling conventions.
The fi rst installment of MEG-C will be published in 2007, 
containing roughly 30 per cent of the texts in the planned 
corpus in ASCII format. It will be on the Internet, accessible 
for anyone to use and download. Our aim with publication 
is two-fold: fi rstly, we will welcome feedback of any kind, and 
especially from scholars who know the texts well; secondly, we 
want to encourage and to see other scholars use the corpus.
