Unicode 5.0 and 5.1 and 
Digital Humanities Projects

In theory, digital humanities projects should rely on standards 
for text and character encoding. For character encoding, 
the standard recommended by TEI P5 (TEI Consortium, eds. 
Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange 
[last modifi ed: 03 Feb 2008], http://www.tei-c.org/P5/) is 
the Unicode Standard (http://www.unicode.org/standard/
standard.html). The choices made by digital projects in 
character encoding can be critical, as they impact text analysis 
and language processing, as well as the creation, storage, and 
retrieval of such textual digital resources. This talk will discuss 
new characters and important features of Unicode 5.0 and 
5.1 that could impact digital humanities projects, discuss the 
process of proposing characters into Unicode, and provide the 
theoretical underpinnings for acceptance of new characters by 
the standards committees. It will also give specifi c case studies 
from recent Unicode proposals in which certain characters 
were not accepted, relaying the discussion in the standards 
committees on why they were not approved. This latter 
topic is important, because decisions made by the standards 
committees ultimately will affect text encoding.
For those characters not in Unicode, the P5 version of the 
TEI Guidelines deftly describes what digital projects should do 
in Chapter 5 (TEI Consortium, eds. “Representation of Non-
standard Characters and Glyphs,” Guidelines for Electronic 
Text Encoding and Interchange [last modifi ed: 03 Feb 
2008], http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/
WD.html [accessed: 24 March 2008]), but one needs to be 
aware of the new characters that are in the standards approval 
process. The presentation will briefl y discuss where to go to 
look for the new characters on public websites, which are “in 
the pipeline.”
The release of Unicode 5.0 in July 2007 has meant that an 
additional 1,369 new characters have been added to the 
standard, and Unicode 5.1, due to be released in April 2008, 
will add 1,624 more (http://www.unicode.org/versions/
Unicode5.1.0/) In order to create projects that take advantage 
of what Unicode and Unicode-compliant software offers, one 
must be kept abreast of developments in this standard and 
make appropriate changes to fonts and documents as needed. 
For projects involving medieval and historic texts, for example, 
the release of 5.1 will include a signifi cant number of European 
medieval letters, as well as new Greek and Latin epigraphic 
letters, editorial brackets and half-brackets, Coptic combining 
marks, Roman weights and measures and coin symbols, Old 
Cyrillic letters and Old Slavonic combining letters. The Menota 
project (http://www.menota.org/guidelines-2/convertors/
convert_2-0-b.page), EMELD’s “School of Best Practice” 
(http://linguistlist.org/emeld/school/classroom/conversion/
index.html), and SIL’s tools (http://scripts.sil.org/Conversion) 
all provide samples of conversion methods for upgrading 
digital projects to include new Unicode characters.
Since Unicode is the accepted standard for character 
encoding, any critical assessment of Unicode made to the 
body in charge of Unicode, the Unicode Technical Committee, 
is generally limited to comments on whether a given character 
is missing in Unicode or--if proposed or currently included 
in Unicode--critiques of a character’s glyph and name, as 
well as its line-breaking properties and sorting position. 
In Chapter 5 of the TEI P5 Guidelines, mention is made of 
character properties, but it does not discuss line-breaking 
or sorting, which are now two components of Unicode 
proposals and are discussed in annexes and standards on the 
Unicode Consortium website (Unicode Standard Annex #14 
“Line Breaking Properties,” Unicode Technical Standard #10, 
“Unicode Collation Algorithm,” both accessible from www.
unicode.org). Users should pay close attention to these two 
features, for an incorrect assignment can account for peculiar 
layout and sorting features in software. Comments on missing 
characters, incorrect glyphs or names, and properties should 
all be directed to the Unicode online contact page (http://
www.unicode.org/reporting.html). It is recommended that an 
addition to Chapter 5 of P5 be made regarding word-breaking 
and collation when defi ning new characters.
The Unicode Standard will, with Unicode 5.1, have over 
100,000 characters encoded, and proposals are underway 
for several unencoded historic and modern minority scripts, 
many through the Script Encoding Initiative at UC Berkeley 
(http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/alpha-script-list.html). 
Reviewing the glyphs, names, and character properties for 
this large number of characters is diffi cult. Assistance from 
the academic world is sought for (a) authoring and review of 
current proposals of unencoded character and scripts, and (b) 
proofi ng the beta versions of Unicode. With the participation 
of digital humanists, this character encoding standard can be 
made a reliable and useful standard for such projects.
