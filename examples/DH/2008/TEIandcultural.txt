Introduction
Since the mid 1990s there has been an increase in the interest 
for the design and use of conceptual models (ontologies) 
in humanities computing and library science, as well as in 
knowledge engineering in general. There is also a wish to use 
such models to enable information interchange. TEI has in its 
20 years of history concentrated on the mark up of functional 
aspects of texts and their parts. That is, a person name is 
marked but linking to information about the real world person 
denoted by that name was not in the main scope. The scope 
of TEI has gradually broadened, however, to include more real 
world information external to the text in question. The Master 
project (Master 2001) is an early example of this change.
In TEI P5 a series of new elements for marking up real world 
information are introduced and several such elements from 
the P4 are adjusted. TEI P5 is meant to be a set of guidelines 
for the encoding of a large variety of texts in many cultural 
contexts. Thus the set of real world oriented elements in TEI 
P5 should not formally be bound to a single ontology. The 
ontological part of TEI P5 is, however, close connected to the 
authors implicit world view. Thus we believe it is important 
to study this part of TEI P5 with some well defi ned ontology 
as a yardstick. Our long experience with memory institution 
sector makes CIDOC CRM (Conceptual Reference Model) a 
natural choice. CIDOC CRM (Crofts 2005) has been proven 
useful as an intellectual aid in the formulation of the intended 
scope of the elements in a new mark up schemes  and we 
believe the model can be useful to clarify the ontological 
part of TEI. This will also clarify what is needed in order to 
harmonize it with major standards like CIDOC CRM, FRBR, 
EAD and CDWA Lite.
CIDOC CRM
CIDOC CRM is a formal ontology intended to facilitate the 
integration, mediation and interchange of heterogeneous 
cultural heritage information. It was developed by 
interdisciplinary teams of experts, coming from fi elds such 
as computer science, archaeology, museum documentation, 
history of arts, natural history, library science, physics and 
philosophy, under the aegis of the International Committee 
for Documentation (CIDOC) of the International Council 
of Museums (ICOM). The harmonisation of CIDOC CRM 
and IFLA’s FRBR (FRBR 1998) is in the process of being 
completed. The EAD has already been mapped to CIDOC 
CRM (Theodoridou 2001).
CIDOC CRM is defi ned in an object oriented formalism 
which allow for a compact defi nition with abstraction and 
generalisation. The model is event centric, that is, actors, places 
and objects are connected via events. CIDOC CRM is a core 
ontology in the sense that the model does not have classes 
for all particulars like for example the Art and Architecture 
Thesaurus with thousands of concepts. CIDOC CRM has little 
more than 80 classes and 130 properties. The most central 
classes and properties for data interchange are shown below.
 
Example: The issue of a medieval charter can be modelled as 
an activity connecting the issuer, witnesses, scribe and place 
and time of issue. The content of the charter is modelled as 
a conceptual object and the parchment as a physical thing. In 
cases where it is necessary for a scholarly analysis and when 
suffi cient information has been preserved, an issuing of a 
charter can be broken down into a series of smaller events, e.g., 
the actual declaration in a court, the writing of the parchment 
and the attachment of the seals. This conceptual analysis can 
be can be used an intellectual aid in the formulation a data 
model and implementation.
In 2005 the CRM was reformulated as a simple XML DTD, 
called CRM-Core, to enable CRM compliant mark up of 
multimedia metadata (Sinclair 2006). A CRM-Core XML 
package may contain information about a single instance 
of any class in the CRM and how it may be connected to 
other objects via events and properties. The German Council 
of Museum has based its standard for XML based museum 
data interchange, MUSEUMDAT, on a combination of the 
Getty standard CDWA Lite and CRM Core.  The CDWA Lite 
revision group currently considers these changes to CDWA 
Lite in order to make it compatible with CRM.  
TEI P5 ontology elements in the light 
of CIDOC CRM
In TEI P5 the new ontologically oriented elements is introduced 
in the module NamesPlaces described in chapter 13 Names, 
Dates, People, and Places. There are additional elements 
described in chapter 10 Manuscript Description, in the TEI 
header and in connection with bibliographic descriptions as 
well. In this paper we concentrate on the elements in chapter 
13.

The central elements in this module are: person, personGrp, org, 
place and event. Person, personGrp and org are “elements which 
provide information about people and their relationships”. 
CIDOC CRM has the corresponding classes with a common 
superclass E29 Actor.
The element event is defi ned as “contains data relating to any 
kind of signifi cant event associated with a person, place, or 
organization” and is similar to the CIDOC CRM class E5 Event 
and its subclasses. In the discussion of the marriage example 
in chapter 13, event element is presented as a “freestanding” 
element. In the formal defi nition it is limited to person and 
org. To make this coherent, the formal part will have to be 
extended or the example have to be changed.
Still event is problematic. The marriage example demonstrates 
that it is impossible to express the role a person has in an 
event. Without knowing the English marriage formalism one 
doesn’t know if the “best man” participated. The very generic 
element persRel introduced in P5 does not solve this problem. 
A possible solution to this problem would be to introduce 
an EventStateLike model class with elements for roles and 
participants.
The model classes orgStateLike, personStateLike, personTraitLik, 
placeStateLike, placeTraitLike group elements used to mark 
up characteristics of persons, organisations and places. The 
elements in ...TraitLike model classes contain information about 
permanent characteristics and the elements in  ...StateLike 
information about more temporal characteristics. The model 
classes contain the generic Trait and State elements in addition to 
specialised elements. The intention is to link all characteristics 
relating to a person, organisation or place. It is not possible to 
make a single mapping from these classes into CIDOC-CRM. 
It will depend partly on which type of trait or strait is used, 
and partly on the way in which it is used. Many characteristics 
will correspond to persistent items like E55 Types, E3 String 
and E41 Appellation, and are connected to actors and places 
through the properties P1 is identifi ed, P2 has type and P2 has 
note. Other elements like fl oruit, which is used to describe a 
person’s active period, are temporal states corresponding to 
the CIDOC-CRM temporal entity E3 Condition State. From an 
ontological point of view the two elements state and trait can 
be considered as generic mechanism for typed linking between 
the major classes.
All the elements in  ...TraitLike and ...StateLike model classes 
can be supplied with the attributes notAfter and notBefore 
defi ning the temporal extension of their validity. This is a very 
powerful mechanism for expressing synoptically information 
based on hidden extensive scholarly investigation about real 
world events. As long as the justifi cation for the values in 
these elements is not present, however, it is hard to map this 
information into an event oriented conceptual model like the 
CRM. Thus, it is important to include descriptions of methods 
for such justifi cation in the guidelines, including examples.
TEI ontology – conclusion
The new elements in TEI P5 bring TEI a great step in the 
direction of an event oriented model. Our use of CRM 
Core as a yardstick has shown that small extensions to and 
adjustments of the P5 elements will enable the expression of 
CRM Core packages by TEI elements. This is a major change to 
our previous suggestions (Ore 2006) in which the ontological 
module was outside TEI. 
To continue this research, an extended TEI tagset should be 
developed with element for abstracts corresponding to the 
ones in FRBR and CRM. This will not change the ontological 
structure of TEI signifi cantly. But these adjustments will make 
the ontological information in a TEI document compliant with 
the other cultural heritage models like for example EAD, 
FRBR/FRBRoo, CIDOC CRM and CDWA-Lite. There is an 
ongoing harmonisation process between all these initiatives in 
which it is important that TEI is a part.

The assumption that authorial style changes over time is a 
reasonable one that is widely accepted in authorship attribution. 
Some important studies concentrate on individual authors, 
using a wide array of methods, and yielding varied results, 
however, so that is unwise to generalize (see the overview in 
Stamou 2007). Henry James’s style, for example, changes in a 
remarkably consistent and extreme way (Hoover 2007), and 
Austen’s stylistic development also seems consistent (Burrows 
1987), but Beckett’s texts are individually innovative without 
showing consistent trends (Stamou 2007: 3). For some authors, 
different investigators have obtained inconsistent results. We 
know of no general study that investigates how authorial style 
changes over a long career. We thus explore how working and 
otherwise living abroad for periods exceeding two years may 
affect an author’s vocabulary and style.
Our presentation begins a broadly based study of the growth 
and decay of authorial vocabulary over time. Although we limit 
our study to nineteenth-century prose, to reduce the number 
of possible variables to a manageable level, we compare French 
and English authors, allowing us to test whether any discovered 
regularities are cross-linguistic. Because authors’ vocabularies 
seem related to their life experiences, we compare authors 
who spent most of their lives in a single geographical area 
with others who traveled and lived extensively abroad. For the 
purposes of this study, we defi ne extensive living and working 
abroad as at least two consecutive years, somewhat longer than 
the contemporary American student’s or faculty member’s 
stay of a semester or a year. This differentiation allows us to 
investigate in what signifi cant ways, if any, extensive foreign 
travel affects an author’s vocabulary.
Our investigation of these questions requires a careful selection 
of authors and texts. Although research is still ongoing, we 
have selected the following eight authors–two in each of the 
four possible categories–for preliminary testing and further 
biographical study:
Digital Humanities 2008_____________________________________________________________________________

Domestic authors:
English
• George Meredith (1828-1909). German schooling at age 
fi fteen, but apparently no signifi cant travel later; fi fteen 
novels published between 1855 and 1895 available in digital 
form.
• Wilkie Collins (1824-1889). No foreign travel mentioned in 
brief biographies; 20 novels available over 38 years.
French 
• Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850). He traveled little outside 
of France until 1843. Subsequent excursions abroad in 
the last seven years of his life, mainly for romance, were 
relatively infrequent and never exceeded fi ve consecutive 
months. Over two dozen novels in digitized format are 
available.
• Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly (1808-1889). Raised in France and 
schooled in the law, he was devoted to his native Normandy 
and seldom ventured abroad. Initially cultivating the image of 
the dandy, his novels and novellas create a curious paradox 
in his later writing between sexually suggestive themes and 
nostalgia for earlier aesthetics and a defense of Catholicism. 
His literary productivity can be divided into the three 
periods of 1831-1844 (fi rst published novel and novella), 
1845-1873 (return to Catholicism; work as both literary 
critic and novelist), and 1874-1889. At least fourteen novels 
or novellas are available in digitized format.
Traveling authors:
English
• Dickens (1812-1870). Seven novels available 1836-43, 
foreign travel for 3 yrs 1844-47, and more travel in 1853-55; 
four novels after 1855 available.
• Trollope (1815-1883). Travel to Brussels in 1834, but 
briefl y; six novels available before 1859, Postal missions to 
Egypt, Scotland, and the West Indies, 1858-59; 1871 trip 
to Australia, New Zealand, and US; travel to Ceylon and 
Australia, 1875, South Africa 1877, Iceland 1878; fi ve novels 
available after 1878.
French
• Arthur de Gobineau (1816-1882). Raised partly in France, 
partly in Germany and Switzerland, he learned German 
and began the study of Persian in school while his mother, 
accused of fraud and estranged from her military husband, 
kept the family a step ahead of the French police. Three 
periods encompassing his publication of fi ction and often 
related to career travel can be divided as follows: 1843-
1852 (at least 4 novellas and 1 novel); 1853-1863 (1 novella); 
1864-1879 (10 novellas, 2 novels). Living mainly in France 
from 1831-1849, he was a protégé of Alexis de Tocqueville, 
who brought him into the French diplomatic service in 
1849. Gobineau was then stationed in Switzerland and 
Germany (1849-1854), Persia (1855-1858, 1861-1863), 
Newfoundland (1859), Greece (1864-1868), Brazil (1868-
1870) and Sweden (1872-1873). Following travel through 
Europe in 1875-77, he left the diplomatic service. His fi rst 
short fi ction was published and serialized in 1846. At least 
a dozen novellas written throughout his career (mostly 
written and published as collections) and two novels (1852 
and 1874) are available in digitized format.  
• Victor Hugo (1802-85). Raised in France except for a 
six-month period in a religious boarding school in Madrid 
(1811-12), Hugo began writing his fi rst novel, Bug-Jargal 
(1826) in 1820. This initial literary period includes 1820-
1851. Aside from a few short trips lasting less than three 
months, Hugo lived and wrote mainly in his homeland 
until his exile on the Island of Guernsey during the reign 
of Louis-Napoléon from 1851-1870. The third period 
encompasses his triumphant return to Paris in 1871 until his 
death, celebrated by a state funeral, in 1885.
Research on the French authors is being facilitated by use of 
PhiloLogic and the ARTFL database, complemented by local 
digitized works and tools that are also used to investigate the 
English authors. 
Preliminary testing must be done on all the authors to discover 
overall trends or principles of vocabulary development 
before investigating any possible effects of foreign travel. The 
importance of this can be seen in fi gures 1 and 2 below, two 
cluster analyses of English traveling authors, based on the 800 
mfw (most frequent words). Dickens’s novels form two distinct 
groups, 1836-43 and 1848-70, a division coinciding with his 
1844-47 travels. For Trollope, the match is not quite so neat, 
but it is suggestive. Ignoring Nina Balatka, a short romance set 
in Prague, and La Vendee, Trollope’s only historical novel, set in 
France in the 1790’s, only two remaining novels in the early 
group were published after his travel to Egypt, Scotland, and 
the West Indies in 1858-59.

Fig. 2 -- Thirty Trollope Novels, 1848-1883
Unfortunately, comparing cluster analyses of the English 
domestic authors casts doubt on any simple correlation 
between travel and major stylistic change. Meredith, like 
Dickens and Trollope, shows a sharp break between his two 
early novels 1855-57 and the rest of his novels (see Fig. 3). And, 
ignoring Antonina (an historical novel about the fall of Rome), 
Collins’s novels also form early and late groups (see Fig. 4).
Fig. 3 – Fifteen Meredith Novels, 1855-895
 
Fig. 4 – Twenty Collins Novels, 1850-1888
Furthermore, although our results for French authors are 
more preliminary, a test of six works by Gobineau shows that 
two of his earliest texts, written before any extensive travel, 
are quite similar to some of his latest texts (see Fig. 5).
 
Fig. 5 – Six Texts by Gobineau
We are still developing the techniques for the study of the 
effects of travel, but preliminary testing based on a division of 
each author’s career into early, middle, and late periods allows 
us to check for consistent trends rather than simple differences 
between early and late texts, and to begin comparing the four 
categories of authors. Choosing novelists with long careers 
allows us to separate the three periods, selecting natural gaps 
in publication where possible, but creating such gaps where 
necessary by omitting some texts from the study. For traveling 
authors, these divisions also take into account the timing of 
their travel, creating gaps that include the travel.
Three stylistic periods create six patterns of highest, middle, 
and lowest frequency for each word in the an author’s texts. 
Depending on the number and size of the novels, we include 
approximately the 8,000 to 10,000 most frequent words, all 
those frequent enough to show a clear increase or decrease 
in frequency; we delete words that appear in only one period. 
Thus, as shown in Fig. 6, each of the six patterns would be 
expected to occur about one-sixth (17%) of the time by 
chance.
Fig. 6 –Six Patterns of Change (“E” = 
early; “M” = middle; “L” = late)
Results for the English authors, shown in Fig. 7, are both 
surprising and suggestive (note that the axis crosses at the 
“expected” 16.7% level, so that it is easy to see which patterns 
are more or less frequent than expected for each author. 
Gradual decrease in frequency, E > M > L, is the only pattern 
more frequent than expected for all four authors (Meredith’s 
fi gure is only very slightly more frequent than expected), and 
both M > E > L and L > E > M are less frequent than expected 
for all four authors. Although the patterns for these authors 
suggest some regularity in the growth and decay of vocabulary, 
no simple relationship emerges. Consider also the surprising 
fact that vocabulary richness tends to decrease chronologically 
for Dickens, Trollope, and possibly Collins, while only Meredith 
shows increasing vocabulary richness. (These comments are 
Digital Humanities 2008_____________________________________________________________________________

based on a relatively simple measure of vocabulary richness, 
the number of different words per 10,000 running words; 
for more discussion of vocabulary richness, see Tweedie and 
Baayen, 1998 and Hoover, 2003.) These facts contradict the 
intuitive assumption that the main trend in a writer’s total 
vocabulary should be the learning of new words.
Similar comparisons are being developed for the French 
authors in question. The conference presentation will include 
not only a comparison of style within each language group, 
but between language groups. Such comparisons also build 
on strengths of corpus stylistics important to translation 
(Goldfi eld 2006) and a possible related future for comparative 
literature (Apter 2005).

A digital edition and research 
platform on the web

In this paper we are presenting the Heinrich Heine Portal, 
one of the most sophisticated web resources dedicated 
to a German classical author. It virtually combines the two 
most defi nitive critical editions (DHA=Düsseldorfer Heine-
Ausgabe and HSA=Heine Säkularausgabe) in print together 
with digital images of the underlying textual originals within 
an elaborated electronic platform. The project, which has been 
established in 2002, is organized as a co-operation between 
the Heinrich-Heine-Institut (Düsseldorf) and the Competence 
Centre for Electronic Publishing and Information Retrieval in 
the Humanities (University of Trier). It has been funded by the 
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research 
Organisation) as well as the Kunststiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen 
(Foundation for the Arts of North Rhine Westphalia). The 
work within the project consists of two major parts. On the 
one hand it has to transfer the printed texts into a digital 
representation which serves as the basis for its electronic 
publication. On the other hand it aims at a complete revision 
of important parts of the printed critical edition and provides 
new results of the Heinrich-Heine research community.
The fi rst part of the workfl ow is organized as a typical 
retro-digitization project. Starting with the printed editions, 
consisting of nearly 26,500 pages with an amount of about 72 
millions of characters, the text was sent to a service partner 
in China, where it was typed in by hand. During this process 
two digital versions of the text were produced and then sent 
back to Germany, where they were automatically collated. 
After that the listed differences were manually corrected 
by comparing them with the printed original. The result of 
this step is a digital text that corresponds with the printed 
version providing a quality of nearly 99.995%. The next task 
was to transform this basic digital encoding into a platform 
independent representation, which then can be used as the 
main data format for all following project phases. In order to 
achieve this goal a pool of program routines was developed 
which uses the typographical information and contextual 
conditions to generate XML-markup according to the TEI 
guidelines. Because of the heterogeneous structures of 
the text (prose, lyrics, critical apparatus, tables of contents 
etc.) this was a very time consuming step. At the end of 
this process a reusable version of the data that can be put

into the archives on a long time basis exists. Using the XML 
encoding the digital documents were imported into an online 
database, where different views onto the data are stored 
separately, e.g. metadata for the main information about the 
letter corpus (list of senders, addressees, dates and places 
etc.) or bibliographical information on the works. In order to 
get access to the information from the database the project 
has been supplied with a sophisticated graphical user interface, 
which has been built with the help of a content management 
framework (ZOPE).
Besides providing online access to the basic editions DHA and 
HSA the Heinrich-Heine-Portal offers a completely revised 
and updated version of the letter corpus and displays newly-
discovered letters and corrigenda, which are being added 
constantly. Additionally, the portal is an electronic archive 
which contains and presents more than 12,000 digital images 
of original manuscripts and fi rst editions, linked to the text and 
the apparatus of the edition. Most of those images were made 
available by the Heinrich-Heine-Institut, Düsseldorf, which 
holds nearly 60% of the Heine-manuscripts known today. 
The collection of the Heine-Institut was completely digitized 
for this project. In addition, 32 other museums, libraries 
and literary archives in Europe and the United States are 
cooperating with the Heine-Portal and have given us consent 
to present manuscripts from their collections. Among them are 
the British Library and the Rothschild Archive in London, the 
Russian Archives of Social and Political History in Moscow, the 
Foundation of Weimar Classics and many others. One of the 
long-term goals of the Heine-Portal is a “virtual unifi cation” of 
all of Heine’s manuscripts. Beyond that the Heine-Portal offers 
extensive bibliographies of primary sources and secondary 
literature, from Heine’s own fi rst publications in a small journal 
(1817) up to the most recent secondary literature. Other 
research tools of the Heine-Portal are a powerful search 
engine and a complex hyperlink structure which connects 
the texts, commentaries and the different sections of the 
Portal with each other and a database of Heine’s letters with 
detailed information on their edition, their availability and the 
institutions which hold them.
Our paper will describe the technical and philological aspects 
of the work process that was necessary for the completion of 
the Heine-Portal, it will give an account of its main functions 
and demonstrate their use for students and scholars alike, and 
it will discuss possible pedagogical applications for schools as 
well as university teaching.
