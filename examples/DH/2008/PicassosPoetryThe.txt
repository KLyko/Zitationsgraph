Introduction
Studying Picasso as writer might seem strange, considering 
that the Spanish artist is mostly known for his paintings. 
However, in the Fall of 2006 we began working on Picasso’s 
writings. Audenaert, et.al. [1], describe the characteristics of 
Picasso’s manuscripts, and the challenges they pose due to 
their pictorial and visual aspects. With over 13,000 artworks 
up-to-date catalogued, the On-line Picasso Project [5] includes 
a historical narrative of relevant events in the artist’s life. In 
this paper we discuss the contents of the texts—from the 
linguistic standpoint—and the implementation of a bilingual 
concordance of terms based on a red-black tree. Although 
concordances have been widely studied and implemented 
within linguistics and humanities, we believe that our collection 
raises interesting challenges; fi rst because of the bilingual 
nature of Picasso’s poems, since he wrote both in Spanish 
and French, and second, because of the connection between 
his texts and his paintings. The work reported in this paper 
focuses on the fi rst issue.
Integrating Texts Into the On-line 
Picasso Project
A catalogue raisonné is a scholarly, systematic list of an 
artist’s known works, or works previously catalogued. The 
organization of the catalogues may vary—by time period, by 
medium, or by style—and it is useful to consult any prefatory 
matter to get an idea of the overall structure imposed by the 
cataloguer. Printed catalogues are by necessity constrained to 
the time in which they are published. Thus, quite often catalogue 
raisonnés are superseded by new volumes or entirely new 
editions, which may (or may not) correct an earlier publication 
[2]. Pablo Picasso’s artistic creations have been documented 
extensively in numerous catalogs. Chipp and Wofsy [3], started 
publishing a catalogue raisonné of Picasso’s works that contains 
an illustrated synthesis of all catalogues to date on the works 
of Pablo Picasso. 
In the Fall of 2007 Picasso’s texts were added to the collection 
along with their corresponding images, and a concordance of 
terms both in Spanish and French was created. The architecture 
created for Picasso’s poems is partially based on the one we 
developed for the poetry of John Donne [7]. As often happens 
in the humanities, each collection has its own characteristics, 
which makes a particular architecture hard if not impossible 
to reuse directly. For example, Donne’s texts are written in 
English; Picasso in contrast wrote both in Spanish and French.
The Concordance of Terms
A concordance, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, 
is “an alphabetical arrangement of the principal words 
contained in a book, with citations of the passages in which 
they occur.”  When applied to a specifi c author’s complete 
works, concordances become useful tools since they allow 
users to locate particular occurrences of one word, or even 
more interestingly, the frequency of such words in the entire 
oeuvre of an author. Apparently, the fi rst concordances in 
English ever put together were done in the thirteenth century, 
and dealt with the words, phrases, and texts in the Bible. Such 
concordances were intended for the specialized scholar of 
biblical texts and were never a popular form of literature. As 
might be expected, these were soon followed by a Shakespeare 
concordance.
A concordance of the literary works of Pablo Picasso has 
more in common with a Biblical concordance than with a 
Shakespearian concordance, due to the manner in which the 
Spanish artist/poet composed his poems. Many critics have 
pointed out the heightened quality of words in Picasso’s 
texts, a value that surpasses their own sentential context. 
One gets the impression that words are simply selected for 
their individual attributes and are then thrown together in the 
poems. Picasso himself appears to admit using this technique 
when he is quoted as saying that “words will eventually fi nd 
a way to get along with each other.” For this reason, readers 
of Picasso’s poems become well aware of the frequent 
recurrence of certain “essential words,” which one is then 
eager to locate precisely in each of the poems to determine 
signifi cant nuances.

By narrowing down the number of these “essential words,” 
the concordance also allows users to delimit the “thematic 
domain” elaborated in Picasso’s writings. Clearly many words 
deal with physical duress and the confrontation between good 
and evil, as manifestations of concrete human suffering during 
the Spanish Civil War and the German occupation of France in 
World War II. By identifying the range of words employed, users 
can clearly determine the political and cultural environment 
that surrounds Picasso’s artistic creations during this period.
Nevertheless, one must not forget that Picasso’s main 
contribution to the world is that of a plastic artist. A 
Concordance will allow users to identify each of the words 
Picasso used and link them to specifi c graphic images in his 
artworks. It has been argued that Picasso’s poetry is quite 
“physical” (he often refers to objects, their different colors, 
textures, etc.). Even in his compositional technique, one gets 
a sense that the way he introduces “physical” words into his 
poems emulates the manner in which he inserted  “found 
objects” in his cubist collages. Many critics have pointed out, 
on the other hand, that Picasso’s art, particularly during his 
Cubist period, is “linguistic” in nature, exploring the language 
of art, the arbitrariness of pictorial expression, etc.  
Mallen [6] argues that Cubism explored a certain intuition 
Picasso had about the creative nature of visual perception. 
Picasso realized that vision involves arbitrary representation, 
but, even more importantly, that painting also does. Once 
understood as an accepted arbitrary code, painting stopped 
being treated as a transparent medium to become an object 
in its own right. From then on, Picasso focused his attention 
on artistic creation as the creative manipulation of arbitrary 
representations. Viewed in this light, painting is merely another 
language, governed by similar strict universal principles as we 
fi nd in verbal language, and equally open to infi nite possibilities 
of expression. A concordance allows users to see these two 
interrelated aspects of Picasso’s career fl eshed out in itemized 
form.
Concordances are often automatically generated from texts, 
and therefore fail to group words by classes (lexical category, 
semantic content, synonymy, metonymy, etc.) The Concordance 
we are developing will allow users to group words in such 
categories, thus concentrating on the network of interrelations 
between words that go far beyond the specifi c occurrences in 
the poems.
Picasso is a bilingual poet. This raises several interesting 
questions connected to what has been pointed out above. 
One may wonder, for instance, if Picasso’s thematic domain is 
“language-bound,” in other words, whether he communicates 
certain concepts in one language but not in the other. A 
Concordance will allow users to set correspondences between 
words in one language and another. Given Picasso’s strong 
Spanish heritage, it would be expected that concrete ideas 
(dealing with food, customs, etc) will tend to be expressed 
exclusively in Spanish, while those ideas dealing with general 
philosophical and religious problems will oscillate between 
the two languages. The possible corroboration of this point is 
another objective of the planned Concordance.

The Red Black Tree Implementation
Term concordances require the extraction of terms from a large 
corpus along with the metadata related to their occurrences, 
an operation often computationally expensive. The Digital 
Donne for instance, is a pre-computed concordance. On the 
other hand, repositories of texts are under constant revision 
as errors are detected and corrected. When the corpus is 
modifi ed, part or the entire concordance has to be rebuilt. To 
solve this problem, the Picasso’s concordance is computed on 
the fl y, without requiring any previous processing.
The repository of poems has initially been divided into poems, 
stanza, and lines, then stored in a database. Using standard join 
operations, the poems are reconstructed, allowing the terms 
to be retrieved along additional metadata such as title, section, 
and line number. Once the poems have been reconstructed, 
each poem line is broken down into terms, which are defi ned 
as a series of characters delimited by a textual space. Each

occurrence of each term in turn, is inserted into the data 
structure, as well as its occurrence metadata.
Our algorithm consists of an augmented data structure 
composed of a Red Black Tree [4,8], where each node 
represents one term found in Picasso’s writings and is used as 
pointer to a linked list. A Red Black Tree is a self balanced binary 
tree, that can achieve insert, delete, and search operations in 
O(log n) time. Because only insertions and random access 
is not required on the linked list, term occurrences can be 
traversed sequentially in O(n) time. Picasso’s literary legacy 
can be browsed and explored using titles as surrogates, which 
are ordered by date and by the term concordance. Each entry 
provides the number of occurrences and its corresponding 
list, which can be used as index to browse the poems.
The retrieval process for terms and their occurrences is 
carried out by selecting specifi c terms or choosing from an 
alphabetical index of letters.  To achieve this, a subtree is 
extracted from the data structure and it is traversed, obtaining 
every occurrence of a term along with additional metadata 
including a unique poem identifi er, page and line number. 
Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLTs) are 
used to transform the resulting XML output, and extract 
the specifi c term occurrences within a line of the poem 
and produce a surrogate, which is composed of a portion 
of the text. Additionally, this surrogate gives access to the 
corresponding poems through hyperlinks.
A new component of our implementation is a Spanish-French 
thesaurus that correlates terms in both languages, along with 
their meanings and commentary. Because our concordance is 
created on the fl y, we have to devise a mechanism to support 
this. Additionally, this approach still remains to be tested 
with different corpuses in other languages, especially where 
terms are separated uniquely and spaces between them play 
a different role in language constructs. The term extraction 
algorithm is effi cient using spaces as delimiters—a common 
case both in Spanish and French. However, other languages 
might include composite words.
