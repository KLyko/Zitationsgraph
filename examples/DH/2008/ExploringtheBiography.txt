Introduction
Scholars and general users of digital editions face a diffi cult 
and problematic scenario when browsing and searching for 
resources that are related to time periods or events. Scrolling 
continuously through a long list of itemized search results 
does not constitute an unusual practice for users when 
dealing with this type of situation. The problem with this 
searching mechanism is that a notion of the corresponding 
dates or keywords associated with the event are required and 
constitute a precondition to a successful search.
An ordered list is unable to provide the required affordances 
and constraints that users need and desire to conduct scholarly 
research properly. It is a common practice among users to 
utilize the search mechanism present in most web browsers, 
and then perform another search among the obtained results 
to “narrow down” or limit the results to a smaller working 
set that is easier to manage. The use of an external search 
mechanism in a digital edition is a strong indicator that improved 
interfaces must be designed, conceived and implemented, just 
to achieve the sole purpose of facilitating scholarly research.
Background
The Online Picasso Project (OPP) is a digital collection and 
repository maintained by the Center for the Study of Digital 
Libraries at Texas A&M University, and the Foreign Languages 
Department at Sam Houston State University. As of November 
2007, it contains 13704 catalogued artworks, 9440 detailed 
biographical entries, a list of references about Picasso’s life 
and works, and a collection of articles from various sources 
regarding the renowned Spanish artist.
How does the OPP provide its content? Java Servlets are 
used to retrieve the documents and metadata from a MySQL 
database. As a result, a Apache Tomcat web server outputs a 
XML which is linked to XSLTs and CSS. The later are used to 
perform a dynamic transformation into standards-compliant 
HTML, achieving a clear separation between content and 
presentation.
The OPP includes an interface that allows scholars and users 
in general to browse through the signifi cant events in his life, 
artworks, and a list of museums and collections that hold 
ownership to the various art objects created by the artist 
during his lifetime. The implemented navigation scheme works 
well for experienced scholars who have a deep knowledge of 
Picasso’s life and works. The amount of available information can 
be overwhelming to the project audience, composed primarily 
of art scholars and historians, because of its magnitude and 
painstaking detail. 
The Humanities rely profoundly on dates to create a strong 
relationship between events and documents. It is obvious to 
assume that key events infl uenced Picasso in such a way, that 
they caused signifi cant changes in artistic style and expression. 
The OPP contains a vast amount of information that could be 
used in conjunction with the proposed interfaces, in order to 
help answer this type of inquiries. The calendars and timelines in 
the OPP propose an alternate method for  exploring an existing 
document collection since they use date-related metadata as 
a discriminating factor, instead of an ordering criterion.  Dates 
are used to provide mechanisms and interfaces that allow rich 
exploration of the artist’s legacy in order to get a more whole 
and concise understanding of his life
Calendars
The calendar interfaces were developed to provide a timetable 
for the creation of artworks and occurrence of events 
cataloged in the OPP. Their purpose is to provide with a quick 
glance, relevant biographical and artistic dates. Additionally, the 
calendars provide means for formulating direct comparisons 
between dates within a single year. months and seasons. 
The calendar interfaces have 5 display possibilities to fi lter 
results, which apply to the artworks and to the narrative:
1. Show start date and end date: used to display “exact 
matches”. 
2. Show start date or end date: 
3. Show start date only: 
4. Show End date only
5. Show Ranges of dates
Surrogates are provided in the form of artwork thumbnails 
and textual description of the events. Clicking on the specifi ed 
date, month or season produces a web page, where detailed 
descriptions can be accessed.

Colors were added to the dates containing items, to show the 
distribution of the artworks and events. The design decision 
to include additional stratifi cation schemes relates to the 
research goal of providing an enhanced browsing mechanism. 
The inclusion of this feature does not implicate any greater 
additional processing of the data, but it provides a richer 
environment for browsing the document collection.

The use of calendar interfaces provides new possibilities for 
scholars and users in general: the discovery of relationships 
between documents, which standard HTML interfaces do not 
facilitate. The main advantages derived from their use include:
1.  The possibility of visualizing an entire year in Picasso’s 
biography and artistic career. 
Through the use of a Calendar-based interface, artworks can 
be visually identifi ed to their specifi c dates of creation. This 
provides a visualization mechanism that allows the user to 
navigate through a potentially large number of artworks in one 
screen. The number of artworks that can be accessed, depends 
on how esthetically prolifi c the artist was in that specifi c year.
Figure 2: Event surrogates – start and end dates
Additionally, this interface allows the users of the project to 
quickly determine periods where the artist was more prolifi c. 
Dates where Picasso was “active” are clearly visible and 
identifi able. This data stratifi cation gives users an additional 
layer of information. 
For the case of biographical events, a similar scenario is 
created. Users can navigate through an entire year of events, 
and the information is presented in a way that affords quick 
navigation and encourages interaction. Visually, periods where 
more events occurred in Picasso’s life are easily identifi able. 
2. The possibility of moving to specifi c day, month or season 
within a year in one single interaction with the interface. 
Through the use of information surrogates, users have the 
possibility of moving to a specifi c day, month or season within 
a year with a single click. The actions produced by scrolling 
through multiple screens are eliminated, and users can view the 
artifacts produced on a specifi c date with ease. Consequently, 
comparisons between artworks can be achieved fl uidly due 
to the enhancements in the browsing environment. Similarly, 
users can read about the specifi c events in Picasso’s biography 
by visually selecting concrete dates. 
The deployment of the Calendar interfaces, produce 
visualizations that enable scholars to determine time periods 
or specifi c dates in Picasso’s life. They serve as a tool that helps 
identify when the artist was more prolifi c, as well the opposite: 
when less artworks were produced. This analysis could also 
be accomplished by browsing through the artwork collection 
but it requires additional interaction from the user, which 
at the end equals more time and effort. The interfaces also 
constitute a new way of browsing the document collection:

visually and in strict correlation to time. They also facilitate 
further exploration of artworks and events in certain days, 
months, seasons and years.
Timelines
This new browsing mechanism in the OPP, based on the Simile 
Timeline, was introduced by placing artworks as markers in 
a time frame. It was designed to allow users to examine the 
artworks produced, along with the recorded events of a given 
year. Further modifi cations were necessary, since the Simile 
Timeline was designed to support single events occurring in 
one day. 
Initially, the timeline was designed to focus only on Picasso’s 
artworks. This design choice gave users great freedom to 
explore large amounts of information in a manipulatable visual 
space. However, the biographical events were being excluded. 
These events included in the OPP, are particularly important 
since provide a historical framework, which is crucial to the 
understanding of the artist’s legacy and are tightly bound to 
his work rhythm.
Moreover, some of the artworks produced by Picasso have a 
certain degree of uncertainty in their dates of creation, since 
their start and end dates were not documented. The timelines 
provide a mechanism for dealing with uncertainty, where the 
artworks are represented with a time bar with a lower level of 
saturation in their color. This gives a visual clue that the start 
and end dates are not fi xed, and are subject to speculation.
Additional information such as changes in style and location 
were injected to the timeline, which were extracted from the 
artist’s biography. Their purpose is to provide an additional 
layer of information that can be used to interpret the events 
that lead to the creation and mood of certain artifacts, and 
thus enhancing the browsing environment.

The advantages gained through the use of timelines include:
1. The possibility of grasping visually time-extensions in 
Picasso’s output.
Picasso worked on several artworks at times, which share a 
similar theme. Even though they share common characteristics, 
they are not identical. Each of these artworks has variations, 
which differentiate them. 
On the other hand, the timelines allow users to freely explore 
all the artworks and events within a given year, and point 
out their similarities and differences, and affords further 
examination regarding the evolution of a common and shared 
theme. 
2. The possibility of visually comparing works ordered in 
chronological order.
The timelines provide a mechanism that fi lters artworks 
according to their year of creation. The enhanced navigational 
scheme provided, allows scholars to view artifacts in 
chronological order. The addition of surrogates allows users 
to point out a specifi c item, and then compare them in relation 
to others through and their time correlation. 
3. The possibility of seeing correlations between change of 
location and artwork creation.
The deployed timelines allow the exploration of correlations 
between location changes and the creation of specifi c artworks. 
Changes in location are marked in the timelines, and clearly 
denote a point in time where exposure to a new or recurring 
context occurred.

they relate to concrete artworks and specifi c locations.

The timelines produce a visualization that puts changes in 
thematic periods and in locations in a common context, along 
with the artworks that were elaborated in that time span. 
This tool is augmented with the navigational ease of clicking 
through a series of artworks, to compare their characteristics 
and perform a deeper analysis if necessary.
The interfaces have been deployed taking into account that 
additional functionality could be introduced with ease. As 
a consequence, information regarding Picasso’s writings 
and poems will be included into the next iteration of the 
timelines and calendars. This will allow a deeper understanding 
of his legacy, since it could potentially provide a greater 
understanding of his artworks and biography. The writings and 
poems constitute a compendium of his thoughts and insights, 
extremely valuable because they were written by the artist 
himself.
The timeline interfaces in the OPP, narrow the gap and visually 
correlate biographical entries with artworks. They provide 
scholars a bigger picture of Picasso’s artistic landscape and 
how events they could have affected his artworks. The dynamic 
nature of the  web-accessible interfaces facilitate the insertion 
of new documents and metadata and thus altering the graphical 
space, which is not feasible on static and printed editions.
