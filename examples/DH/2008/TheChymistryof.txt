My paper will examine both a specifi c digital humanities project, 
The Chymistry of Isaac Newton <http://www.chymistry.org/>, 
and refl ect more broadly on the fi eld of digital humanities, by 
suggesting useful parallels between the disciplines of alchemy 
and digital humanities. The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project is 
an effort to digitize and edit the alchemical writings of Newton 
and to develop digital scholarly tools (reference, annotation, 
and visualization) for interacting with the collection.
Newton’s “chymistry” has recently become a topic of 
widespread public interest.[1] It is no longer a secret that the 
pre-eminent scientist of the seventeenth century spent some 
thirty years working in his alchemical laboratory, or that he 
left a manuscript Nachlass of about 1,000,000 words devoted 
to alchemy. Newton’s long involvement in chymistry fi gures 
prominently in NOVA’s 2005 “Newton’s Dark Secrets,” and 
it occupies a major portion of the documentary’s website 
at <http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/>. Even more 
attention was devoted to Newton’s alchemy in the 2003 BBC 
production “Newton: The Dark Heretic.” Newton’s chymistry 
also is featured in recent popularizing studies such as Gleick’s 
2003 Isaac Newton and White’s 1997 Isaac Newton: the Last 
Sorcerer. Despite the fascination that Newton’s chymistry holds 
for the public, the subject has not received a corresponding 
degree of scrutiny from historians since the untimely passing 
of B.J.T. Dobbs in 1994 and Richard Westfall in 1996. Dobbs 
had made the issue of Newton’s alchemy a cause célèbre in her 
infl uential historical monograph, The Foundations of Newton’s 
Alchemy of 1975, and Westfall built upon her work in his own 
magisterial biography of Newton, Never at Rest , of 1980.
The relative lack of subsequent scholarly grappling with 
Newton’s alchemy is regrettable for many reasons, particularly 
since Dobbs and Westfall raised strong claims about the 
relationship of his alchemical endeavors to his physics. In 
particular, they suggested that Newton’s concept of force at 
a distance was strongly infl uenced by his work in alchemy, 
and that it was alchemy above all else that weaned Newton 
away from the Cartesian mechanical universe in favor of a 
world governed by dynamic interactions operating both at the 
macrolevel and the microlevel. Although Dobbs backed away 
from these earlier positions in her 1991 Janus Faces of Genius, 
she made the equally strong claim there that Newton’s alchemy 
was primarily concerned with the operations of a semi-material 
ether that acted as God’s special agent in the material world. 
Westfall too emphasized the putative connections between 
Newton’s religion and his alchemy.

Interestingly, the historical speculations of Westfall, Dobbs, 
and their popularizers have relatively little to say about the 
relationship of Newton’s alchemy to the alchemical tradition 
that he inherited. Perhaps because of the underdeveloped state 
of the historiography of alchemy in the 1970s, both Westfall 
and Dobbs portrayed Newton’s seemingly obsessive interest 
in the subject as something exotic that required the help of 
extradisciplinary motives to explain it. Hence Dobbs looked 
beyond chymistry itself, invoking the aid of Jungian psychology 
in her Foundations (1975) and that of Newton’s heterodox 
religiosity in her Janus Faces (1991). In neither case did she 
see chymistry as a fi eld that might have attracted Newton 
on its own merits. Recent scholarship, however, has thrown a 
very different picture on alchemy in the seventeenth-century 
English speaking world. We now know that Newton’s associate 
Robert Boyle was a devoted practitioner of the aurifi c art, 
and that the most infl uential chymical writer of the later 
seventeenth century, Eirenaeus Philalethes, was actually the 
Harvard-trained experimentalist George Starkey, who tutored 
Boyle in chymistry during the early 1650s. Boyle’s “literary 
executor,” the empiricist philosopher John Locke, was also 
deeply involved in chrysopoetic chymistry, and even Newton’s 
great mathematical rival, Leibniz, had an abiding interest in the 
subject. In short, it was the norm rather than the exception 
for serious scientifi c thinkers of the seventeenth century to 
engage themselves with chymistry. We need no longer express 
amazement at the involvement of Newton in the aurifi c art, but 
should ask, rather, how he interacted with the practices and 
beliefs of his predecessors and peers in the burgeoning fi eld 
of seventeenth-century chymistry. A fi rst step in this endeavor, 
obviously, lies in sorting out Newton’s chymical papers and 
making them available, along with appropriate digital scholarly 
tools, for systematic analysis.
The most recent phase of the project focuses on digital tools, 
including a digital reference work based on Newton’s Index 
Chemicus, an index, with bibliographic references, to the fi eld 
and literature of alchemy. Newton’s Index includes 126 pages 
with 920 entries, including detailed glosses and bibliographic 
references. Our online reference work edition of Newton’s 
Index will not be constrained by Newton’s original structure 
and will extend functionality found in traditional print-based 
reference works. It will leverage information technologies 
such as searching and cross-linking to serve as an access point 
to the domain of seventeenth-century alchemy and a portal to 
the larger collection and to visualizations that graphically plot 
the relative occurrences of alchemical terms, bibliographic 
references, and other features of the collection. Other tools 
being developed include systems for user annotation of XML-
encoded texts and facsimile page images.
My presentation will look at current progress, developments, 
and challenges of the Chymistry of Isaac Newton. With this 
project as context, I will venture into more theoretical areas 
and examine parallels between alchemy and digital humanities. 
For example, like digital humanities, alchemy was an inherently 
interdisciplinary fi eld. Bruce T. Moran, in his Distilling Knowlege 
describes alchemy as an activity “responding to nature so as 
to make things happen without necessarily having the proven 
answer for why they happen” (10). This approach has a 
counterpart in the playful experimentation and affection for 
serendipitious discovery found in much digital humanities work. 
Moran also explains that the “primary procedure” of alchemy 
was distillation, the principle purpose of which was to “make the 
purest substance of all, something linked, it was thought, to the 
fi rst stuff of creation” (11). Similarly, much of digital humanities 
work is a process of distillation in which visualizations or 
XML trees, for instance, are employed to reveal the “purest 
substance” of the text or data set. Codes and symbols and 
metadata were important parts of the alchemical discipline, as 
they are in digital humanities. Alchemy also had a precarious 
place in the curriculum. Moran, again, indicates that “although 
a sprinkling of interest may be found in the subject within the 
university, it was, as a manual art, always denied a part in the 
scholastic curriculum” (34). Digital Humanities is likewise often 
cordoned off from traditional humanities departments, and its 
practice and research is conducted in special research centers, 
newly created departments of digital humanities, or in schools 
of information science. The idea of the alchemist as artisan and 
the digital humanist as technician is another interesting parallel 
between the two fi elds. My paper will examine these and other 
similarities between the two fi elds and examine more closely 
the works of individual alchemists, scientists, and artists in this 
comparative context. Alchemy is an interdisciplinary fi eld--
like much digital humanities work--that combines empirical 
science, philosophy, spirituality, literature, myth and magic, 
tools and totems. I will argue that, as we escape the caricature 
of alchemy as a pseudo-science preoccupied with the occult, 
alchemy can serve as a useful model for future directions in 
digital humanities.
[1]As William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe have 
argued in several co-authored publications, it is anachronistic 
to distinguish “alchemy” from “chemistry” in the seventeenth 
century. The attempt to transmute metals was a normal 
pursuit carried out by most of those who were engaged in 
the varied realm of iatrochemistry, scientifi c metallurgy, and 
chemical technology. The fact that Newton, Boyle, Locke, 
and other celebrated natural philosophers were engaged 
in chrysopoeia is no aberration by seventeenth-century 
standards. Hence Newman and Principe have adopted the 
inclusive term “chymistry,” an actor’s category employed 
during the seventeenth century, to describe this overarching 
discipline. See William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe, 
“Alchemy vs. Chemistry: The Etymological Origins of a 
Historiographic Mistake,” Early Science and Medicine 3(1998), 
pp. 32-65. Principe and Newman, “Some Problems with the 
Historiography of Alchemy,” in William R. Newman and 
Anthony Grafton, Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy
