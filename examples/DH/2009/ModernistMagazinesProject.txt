The critic Michael Levenson warned that “A coarse-ly understood modernism is at once an historical 
scandal and a contemporary disability”. The Modern-
ist	Magazine	Project	aims	to	refine	and	enhance	the	re-
cord through the production of a scholarly resource and 
comprehensive critical and cultural history of modern-
ist magazines in the period 1880-1945. So-called ‘little 
magazines’	were	small,	independent	publishing	ventures	
committed to new and experimental work. Literally 
hundreds	 of	 such	magazines	 flourished	 in	 this	 period,	
providing an indispensable forum for modernist innova-
tion and debate. They helped sustain small artistic com-
munities, strengthened the resolve of small iconoclastic 
groups, keen to change the world, and gave many ma-
jor	modernists	their	first	opportunities	in	print.	Many	of	
these magazines existed only for a few issues and then 
collapsed; but almost all of them contained work of out-
standing	originality	and	future	significance.
The project aims to document and analyse the role of 
both fugitive and more established magazines and to 
consider their contribution to the construction of mod-
ernism in Britain, Europe and North America. It will re-
sult in a 3 volume Critical and Cultural History of Mod-
ernist Magazines, an Anthology and an online resource, 
comprising an index of magazines, bibliographical and 
biographical data, selected contents and web links.
What this paper wants to focus on is the design and ac-
tual implementation of the online resource together with 
all	the	critical	and	technical	thinking	involved	in	defin-
ing	every	step	of	workflow.
The	first	part	involved	thinking	about	the	proper	formats	
and standards which would best suit the project needs 
and at the same time would be able to be conformant 
with the current best practices and the widely advocated 
interoperability and preservation issues. Therefore a nat-
ural choice has been the adoption of Library of Congress 
standards related to the implementation of both general 
descriptive	metadata	 and	 specific	 solutions	 for	 the	 do-
main of digital libraries. In particular the standards in-
volved are MODS1, METS2, MADS3, having also a look 
at PREMIS4.
All these standards at the same time provide for and 
prefer an XML serialization, which, given the almost 
ubiquitous support of this syntax by the current web 
frameworks, allows for many different possibilities in 
choosing	 the	 underlying	 technology.	 The	 final	 choice	
consisted in the eXist XML Native Database5. Being 
under open-source development for several years, this 
database has been constantly growing in features, per-
formance and user base, becoming not only a mere data 
storage layer, but, thanks to the integration with Apache 
Cocoon6 which allowed for the possibility of creating 
processing pipelines composed by XQuery and XSLT, 
an actual and complete web framework.
A particular focus will be dedicated to the strategies 
implemented for converting from non structured data 
to MODS metadata, so to facilitate the work of the de-
veloper, since the data collecting has been made by an 
expert in modernism, but with few skills in metadata 
management. A key point has been the preparation of 
Excel forms, which allowed for the gathering of semi-
structured data and the subsequent development of a 
conversion program based on Apache POI7 and JDOM8 
API for the direct creation of MODS compliant meta-
data.  In particular the difference between the tabular 
structure of Excel and the nested tree structure of XML 
required the implementation of some particular algorith-
mic strategies.
What will be discussed next is the use of MADS for re-
cording the different name versions and pseudonyms, the 
creation of a MODS extension, compatible with METS, 
for recording the information about the digital images of 
the magazines pages, and the subsequent display of these 
images using the YUI framework9.
The last part of the presentation will be about a proof-
of-concept integration between the Modernist Maga-
zines Project and the thematic-related Modernist Journal 
Project, based on the use Web 2.0 techniques, in particu-
lar Ajax and REST Web Services10.
