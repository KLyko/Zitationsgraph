1 Introduction 
This paper provides an overview of methods used in bespoke software, MIHS (Mining Interactive His-
torical Sources), currently under development. This pa-
per considers associational culture and the development 
of Irish nationalism through the anthropological idea of 
Othering [1] and how customised software aids knowl-
edge construction and historical research. 
A brief overview of the historical question reveals that 
the concept of the Other is a changing manifestation of 
socio-economic and political conditions. It con structs 
group identity by labeling and categorising the core 
group but more importantly those outside it. Irish iden-
tity and nationalism, for example, during the eighteenth 
century is immersed in ideas of Othering, as political and 
social expressions, such as the Penal Laws
1
, demonstrate 
how one group, Protestants, ascribe negative attributes 
to	label	and	define	the	Other	group,	Catholics,	as	second	
class citizens. This historical research uses customised 
software that aids knowledge construction by provid-
ing an interface and central environment to digitise, 
store and share sources. The software provides an ap-
plication to cre ate and extract information by developing 
factoids,	defined	as	the	connection	of	“different	kinds	of	
structured information” [2], from primary and second-
ary sources. These factoids are dynamically generated 
by	the	system	in	response	to	researcher-defined	queries.	
They are composed of factlets and additional XML en-
coded source information; factlets themselves are obser-
vations on sources, chosen and manually encoded by the 
researcher.  The environment also uses data mining, or 
knowledge mining [3], techniques to generate organised 
clusters of factoids, called data clusters. 
MIHS provides a user friendly interface for historians to 
create and generate an information environment driven 
by their research question. It creates a database contain-
ing relevant information about sources so, for example, 
a bibliography and footnotes can be produced. However, 
the	database	is	“an	intermediate	act,	not	a	final	one”	[2].	
The software supports the user in the generation of fac-
toids, the research-driven encodings of researcher-rele-
vant information, derived from uploaded images of pri-
mary and secondary sources.  It therefore allows the user 
to	refine	and	define	information	of	interest	and	value	in	
order to solve, or inform, the research question. The gen-
eration	of	factoids	encapsulates	the	researchers’	thinking	
and demonstrates links and relationships between sourc-
es and theory based on the research question. 
2 Historical Research using Factoids 
Bradley and Short discuss the use of factoids in relation 
to prosopography as a means to provide material for fu-
ture research and assert that “a collection of factoids does 
not	record	a	‘scholarly	overview’	of	a	person	[event]	that	
a scholar has derived from the sources s/he has read” [2]. 
In this context the factoids rep resent pure information 
and are not driven or shaped by any research question or 
agenda. Projects such as The Prospography of the Byz-
antine Empire, described by Bradley and Short, provide 
a vast array of information searchable by, amongst oth-
ers, factoid type and source type, and are invaluable to 
anyone	interested	in	this	field	of	study.	The	use	of	fac-
toids ensures information is presented in a struc tured, 
relation-based fashion. It provides interaction between 
different sources and enhances scholarly research. How-
ever, Bradley and Short argue that “one of the diffculties 
with a factoid approach is to establish what kind of ‘fac-
toids’	should	be	collected	from	the	source”	[2].	With	this	
approach, those creating the prosopography database 
must predict what future users may or may not require. 
In contrast, MIHS is research driven – factoids are pro-
duced in the context of the research question. The soft-
ware is not only a digital research tool but forms an in-
tegral part of the methodology as the software creates 
factoids based on a “scholarly overview” [2] and schol-
arly interpretation. The source is encoded using XML 
(see Figure 1,2,3), though an abstraction of XML is pre-
sented to the user where element names and attributes 
are	defined.	This	 ensures	 the	user	 controls	 the	 schema	
and subsequent representations of the source within the 
software (tags and categories previously used will be 
highlighted to ensure continuity) and the actual “task of 
categorising, grouping and ordering” [2] sources opens 
a conversation between the user, the sources and the re-
search question.

Factoids are produced through user and source interac-
tion and the utilisation of the software. To create fac-
toids	the	user	must	first	define	numerous	factlets	from	a	
source. Each factlet inherits core information from the 
original source such as location, date, author, etc. Fact-
lets from different sources that are related by subject or 
category, for instance, then merge to create a factoid. 
The user will extract information from encoded sources 
whilst preserving the integrity of the information through 
easy access to the original source image, thus maintain-
ing source context. Metadata, providing original source 
information, is available for each factlet contained in a 
factoid (and indeed factoids presented in data clus ters) 
and is expressed using the Dublin Core Metadata stan-
dard. 
A typical use, for example is as follows “How do the 
Penal Laws categorise Catholics as the Other in Irish so-
ciety?” To answer this question, pamphlets, periodicals, 
newspapers and other text based sources are used. Figure 
4 demon strates the interaction between source material 
and the creation of factoids. This example is constructed 
from a small dataset. As the number of sources increase 
the	 benefit	 of	 this	 type	 of	 data	 organisation	 becomes	
more obvious. The factoid in Figure 4 represents sources 
which are concerned with the Penal Laws. In a larger 
dataset,	 this	 factoid	can	be	 refined	or	defined	by	using	
relational operators and set relations, creating factoids 
specific	to	the	user.	
Another project that has yielded a database system for 
prosopography, the COEL database, states a fundamen-
tal approach requires that “the data must always be pro-
tected against contamination by the interpretation” [4]. 
This type of approach may be required when presenting 
historical sources and informa tion for general consump-
tion but in MIHS, user interpretations are paramount. 
MIHS	presents	users	arguments	and	reflects	his/her	line	
of thought through the construction of factoids. The abil-
ity to return to original sources ensures context remains 
and leaves a forum open for historical debate.

Law factoid 
The production of factoids is followed by the use of data 
mining techniques to generate data clusters. This ap-
proach will help with the complexities and magnitude 
of large data sets and the presentation of large quantities 
of factoids.

3 Text mining using factoids in MIHS 
Data mining methodologies are commonly used within 
retail,	marketing	and	financial	industries.	They	are	used	
to derive patterns, associations and correla tions from 
small to large datasets, utilising database architecture 
such as data warehousing, which result in the extraction 
of data knowledge [3]. Data mining adds value to raw 
data. Yet apart from its advantages in terms of statistics, 
data mining techniques can be used for text documents 
– text mining. Like data mining, it derives patterns and 
relations from texts and can be used “as part of-speech 
tagging, word sense disambiguation and bilingual dic-
tionary creation” [5]. It can also be used to create syn-
opsis of text by (excluding -the, of, is etc.) calculating 
frequently used words. 
MIHS will use text mining to provide graphical models 
of data where factoids are represented as nodes on a tree. 
By using text mining we can extrapolate extra informa-
tion either from the original text and/or related factoids. 
Text mining techniques enable the software to carry out 
text analysis on source material.  For instance, the re-
searcher can input milestones like the 1798 Rebellion, 
and, through language comparison and analysis, inter-
pret changes in society.  This may allow the researcher 
to move towards answering questions such as “After 
the failure of the 1798 Rebellion is there evidence of a 
change in attitude towards Irish Catholics?” This tech-
nique often yields interesting results because “even if a 
word	only	appears	once	or	twice	it	can	be	significant	if	
it does not appear at all in the [text] used for compari-
son” [6]. By mining factoids related to the Penal Laws 
and specifying dates such as 1798 – which has important 
consequences for both Irish Protestants and Catholics – 
the changing socio dynamics emerge through text com-
parisons, highlighting changes in descriptions and atti-
tudes towards and within the different religious groups. 
4 Conclusion 
The ultimate aim of the software is to create an on-line 
community of historians, research and sources, support-
ing individual and collaborative projects. It will fa cilitate 
access to sources, facts and factoids related to research 
projects, which can be viewed as separate entities or part 
of scholarly interpretation. MIHS will provide a generic 
information platform for historians, moving away from 
software	designed	for	specific	research	projects,	to	cre-
ate a platform for historical debate where users can share 
sources, factoids and, of course, ideas. MIHS will allow 
for the construction of database architectures without the 
complexities often inherent in the creation of historical 
databases. 
The process of managing the vast array of sources re-
quired for historical research can be a mammoth task, 
both in terms of handling the large volumes of data and 
the subsequent interpretation of sources. MIHS, through 
the creation of factoids and use of text mining, provides 
the means to store and organise sources collected. By 
allowing for self organisation of data, recommendations 
for data mining, references to related data and manu-
scripts, the creation of factlets and factoids, among oth-
ers, MIHS will serve as an important tool in creating 
well-read and well-informed historical projects.

1The Penal Laws were a series of anti-Catholic laws 
passed in Ireland during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
century.
