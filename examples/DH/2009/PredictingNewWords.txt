This study models the integration of new lexical borrowings into French, a language in which new 
lexical borrowings are common. Our goal is to predict 
whether or not a new lexical borrowing will “survive” 
the onslaught of time and be integrated into French. 
In linguistics, most theories of word formation have been 
conducted in the generative tradition, such as those tak-
en by Aronoff (1976), Selkirk (1982), Halle & Marantz 
(1993), and Ussishkin (2005). These approaches work 
well	for	new	words	formed	by	affixation	and	address,	for	
example, how to form the neologism hateable from hate 
according to the same rules from which we have love --> 
loveable. Yet these theories have not addressed the pro-
ductivity of borrowings. Although borrowings may have 
internal morphological structure in the donor language, 
their adoption in French is not governed by structural 
rules as studied in theoretical morphology. The goal of 
the present study is to address the non-structural factors 
that	codetermine	whether	a	borrowing	will	find	its	way	
into the vocabulary of the recipient language. 
Although many words from other languages enjoy 
ephemeral use, the borrowings that become entrenched 
in the language are a highly constrained subset of the 
possible borrowings: new words do not occur indiscrim-
inately. Several factors may promote entrenchment in 
the	recipient	language’s	lexicon.	
First, the DONOR LANGUAGE of a borrowing may 
play a role in lexical integration. For example, borrow-
ings from a prestigious language like English could be 
more likely to be integrated into the French lexicon than 
borrowings from a less prestigious language like Polish. 
Second,	a	borrowing’s	FREQUENCY	at	a	given	moment	
in	time	could	be	an	influential	predictor	about	the	borrow-
ing’s	integration	into	the	language	at	a	later	point	in	time.	
Third,	a	borrowing’s	DISPERSION—the	number	of	dif-
ferent text chunks a word occurs in if a text is divided

into several sub-parts—also promises to be a worthwhile 
predictor. The more writers/speakers use a borrowing, 
the greater likelihood it has of becoming entrenched in 
the language community. Fourth, since shorter borrow-
ings require less processing effort, we hypothesize that 
the LENGTH of the borrowing will be inversely related 
to the degree of integration of a borrowing. Fifth, the 
SENSE PATTERN (monosemy or polsemy) of aborrow-
ing in the recipient language may also be at issue. A se-
mantically rich borrowing might have a greater chance 
of surviving than a semantically and contextually highly 
restricted, specialized, borrowing. Finally, we consider 
as well a cultural context factor, whether or not the bor-
rowing refers to a culture that typically corresponds to 
the language of the borrowing. It is possible that a cultur-
ally unrestricted borrowing, for example, a Russian bor-
rowing when describing China, could indicate a greater 
degree of integration than a restricted cultural context in 
which a Russian borrowing describes Russia.

Table1. A multiple regression model for predicting 
integration of lexical borrowings into French. 
This study gathered initial new borrowings from the Le 
Monde corpus (Abeillé et al. 2003) from 1989–1992. 
We alsoqueried the online archives of Le Figaro for the 
borrowings from 1996–2006, taking occurrence in this 
second corpus as a proxy for integration into the French 
lexicon. Given the frequency, the dispersion, the length, 
the	 donor	 language	 of	 the	 borrowing,	 the	 borrowing’s	
sense pattern and its cultural context in Le Monde, we 
developed a multiple regression model predicting the 
frequency of occurrence of the borrowing in the later 
Le Figaro corpus. Our model succeeded in explaining a 
high proportion of the variance in the Le Figaro frequen-
cies	(R2	=0.673,	with	minimal	overfitting	as	evidenced	
by bootstrap validation). Table 1 summarizes this model.
Table	1	shows	a	highly	significant	main	effect	for	disper-
sion. The effect of dispersion is modulated by an interac-
tion with frequency, indicating the role of frequency is 
restricted to words that have a broad dispersion. Com-
paring frequency and dispersion, dispersion emerges as 
the pre-eminent predictor for integration into the lexicon. 
Length, operationalized in terms of number of syllables, 
emerged with a negative slope, as expected. The effect 
of length depended on the cultural context. In culturally 
unrestricted contexts, longer borrowings are less likely 
to be integrated into the lexicon. Polysemous borrow-
ings, borrowings with another sense already existing in 
the language, are also more likely to be integrated into 
the lexicon than borrowings that do not have another 
sense. Finally, the cultural context variable turned out to 
modulate the effect of most other predictors (frequency, 
length, sense, and donor language). 
We have documented a range of factors that codetermine 
the acceptance of borrowings in a new language. These 
factors may play a role not only for the entrenchment 
of borrowings, but also for the entrenchment of regular 
morphologically complex neologisms, complement-
ing the structure-directed investigations of theoretical 
morphology. An important direction for future research 
is to investigate whether, and if so how, the weights of 
the factors documented here are modulated by the inter-
nal	 structure	 of	 complex	words	 (across	 affixed	words,	
blends, and acronyms). 
Unlike other types of word formation, borrowings allow 
us to gauge the degree of interaction between cultures. 
The cultural context factor in the present study, for in-
stance, suggests that borrowings can be used to trace 
how concepts from dominant cultures establish them-
selves in the language community and spread to those 
contexts where subordinate cultures are in focus. This 
information is not only of use to linguists, but also to 
sociologists and anthropologists. 
The methodology outlined in the present study may also 
be of use for lexicography, as it makes it possible to pre-
dict which borrowings (and other neologisms) are in the 
process of becoming entrenched in the language com-
munity, and therefore merit inclusion in dictionaries.
