The purpose of this paper is to promote the discus-sion	on	what	are	the	key	dimensions	of	humanities’	
scholarship, and how they can be best represented by 
means of formal languages in the context of the Seman-
tic Web. Quite often, available formalizations of knowl-
edge domains and practices in the humanities have been 
inspired	 by	 previous	work	 on	more	 rigorous	 scientific	
domains. As a result, we believe that the models thus cre-
ated tend to oversimplify, if not totally misunderstand, 
the complexity and peculiarity of the work of humani-
ties’	scholars.	In	this	paper,	we	want	to	highlight	a	num-
ber of characteristics that need to be taken into account 
when	modeling	humanities’	data.	We	argue	that	only	by	
keeping in mind such requirements we will be able to lay 
out solid foundations for facilitating non-trivial informa-
tion integration in humanities domains. We are currently 
testing	these	ideas	in	our	department	by	reflecting	upon	
anumber of preexisting digital humanities projects. The 
final	paper	will	give	a	more	extensive	description	of	this	
evaluation. 
Introduction 
In recent years we have seen a proliferation of research 
and commercial projects aiming at the dissemination of 
a large number of structured or semi-structured data. 
On the academic side, for example, enterprises such as 
the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) have long 
attempted to support the creation of a vast-scale layer 
of machine-processable data, which should work as 
an		‘extension’	of	the	traditional	web.	Less	academic	ex-
amples are instead Freebase (Freebase, 2007), a web ap-
plication aiming at becoming an “open, shared database 
of	the	world’s	knowledge”	which	can	be	freely	edited	by	
registered users, and the DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), a 
community effort to extract structured information from 
Wikipedia and make it available on the web by means of 
a public API1. 
In this paper, we associate these developments in web

technologies with the term ‘semantic web’ (SW), as they 
all share the intent to encode formally (with varying de-
grees of complexity) aspects of the meaning of the re-
sources or artifacts they refer to. 
It is worth asking then, why should we as digital human-
ists be adopting a semantic web approach? A primary ad-
vantage of having structured data exposed on the web is 
the possibility to integrate and reuse them in novel ways. 
For example, we can imagine a scenario where data 
coming from an archeological project about Tutankha-
mun are being accessed by other archeologists interested 
in pottery produced in Egypt in the same period. Pushing 
it a little further, we could also think of a research group 
in sociology of science examining the same data, look-
ing	 for	 anomalous	 patterns	 in	 the	 archeologists’	 daily	
data-collection practices. 
From an examination of the most recent literature, it is 
easy to conclude that semantic web technologies have al-
ready been tested in a variety of domains. These include 
both hard science domains, such as physics (Friedland 
and Allen, 2004), biology (Bechhofer et al., 2006), math-
ematics (Habel and Magnan, 2007), but also humani-
ties’	disciplines	such	as	history	of	art	(Hildebrand	et	al.,	
2006), literature (Nowviskie, 2005), music (Schraefel et 
al., 2005). 
However, this spectrum of experimentations leads us to a 
further	consideration.	Since	scientific	domains	are	high-
ly structured they can more easily be mapped into formal 
conceptual schemas, so as to be used in SW applications 
-e.g., a gene ontology, or an ontology of hardware com-
ponents. This is not the case for all humanities domains, 
especially where scholars give high value to processes 
like the expression of subjective interpretations and the 
debate on the subject in question, rather than aiming to 
search for objective schemas or universal taxonomies. In 
other words, the task of modeling knowledge domains 
in the humanities through formal languages (so as to al-
low computability and data integration) presents various 
challenges which are still to be tackled by existing re-
search on the semantic web front.2 
For example, it is our view that systems such as /fac-
et (Hildebrand et al., 2006) or CultureSampo (Eero 
Hyvönen et al., 2007), although providing advanced in-
terfaces	 for	 exploring	humanities’	data,	do	not	 investi-
gate	enough	the	type	of	semantic		‘services’	humanities’	
scholars often engage with in their research practices. In 
fact,	very	often	such	systems	make	use	of	very		‘shallow’	
semantic	models	(e.g.,	a		‘person’	who	created	a		‘work’	
which belongs-to	a		‘style’),	thus	oversimplifying	the	ac-
tual discourse that makes a statement valuable within a 
humanities discipline. As a consequence, data thus struc-
tured can hardly be of use to the humanities scholar in 
her research and activities.  
If data sharing and integration in the humanities is rec-
ognized to be worth pursuing, it is therefore necessary to 
build some solid foundations for a truly useful semantic 
web	framework	in	the	humanities.	The	first	activity	that	
will help us in this respect is a thorough consideration of 
the typical entities and practices	emerging	in	humanities’	
research. Accordingly, in section 3 we outline a number 
of	key	requirements	humanities’	semantic	models	should	
support. In the following section we spend some words 
on the approach that drivesour usage of ontologies for 
data integration. 
Ontology: a beauty or a beast? 
A central notion in the semantic web and in the world of 
data integration is that one of ontology. The widely used 
definition	by	Gruber	(Gruber,	1993)	describes	it	as	“an	
explicit	 specification	 of	 a	 conceptualization”.	 Being	 a	
conceptualization an ontology is therefore a stylized rep-
resentation of the world; secondly, since it is expressed 
in a formal	language,	an	ontology	can	be	defined	unam-
biguously. As a consequence, ontologies are well suited 
representation languages for describing data and sharing 
information; their employment is also endorsed by the 
W3C (W3C, 2004). 
Besides this quite conventional view of what an ontol-
ogy is, the debate is ongoing about the status of an on-
tology with respect to the world it represents. For ex-
ample, some authors such as Smith (Smith, 2003) hold a 
realist position, while others such as the aforementioned 
Gruber (Gruber, 2003) support a more pragmatic view. 
Such positions affect inevitably the way ontologies are 
developed	and	used.	For	example,	in	the	first	case	(real-
ist) the implicit assumption is that the ontology should 
approximate	to	a		‘true’	reality;	as	a	consequence,	mul-
tiple ontologies about the same subject should ultimately 
converge in their modeling choices. On the contrary, the 
second class of ontology-design approaches (pragma-
tist) seean ontology essentially as an engineering arti-
fact: thus, it does not hold any absolute value about the 
reality it depicts, but it provides a practical solution to 
the		‘problems’	it	was	designed	to	tackle	(i.e.	it	is	a	mean 
to an end). 
Although in the SW world both approaches have many 
followers, the context in which digital humanities prac-
titioners and researchers operate, in our opinion, is much 
closer to the pragmatic approach. Indeed, the humani-
ties are often perceived as the place where all the voices 
—provided they are respectful of certain argumentative 
DIGITAL HUMANITIES 2009
Page  213
conventions—can be heard, and where all the assump-
tions can be questioned. Therefore, ontologies for the 
humanities must support diversity and variety of view-
points; thus they cannot adhere to an underlying model 
which neglects multiplicity in favor of a monolithic vi-
sion of the world. 
Following Gruber (Gruber, 2003), we therefore intend 
to promote the concept of an ontology as the agreement 
reached by multiple parties (e.g., programmers, scien-
tists, collaborators, librarians) with the aim of accom-
plishing some objectives (e.g., data exchange between 
applications, communication between people, integra-
tion of disparate representations). Using a metaphor, on-
tologies are contracts, they are the currency used to per-
form some valuable operations. Thus, their importance is 
ultimately related not to their truth or beauty, but to the 
ease they bring to the collaboration among people3. To 
use	a	less		‘commercial’	metaphor	an	ontology	is	a	com-
promise	or	a	point	of	contact	between	specific	and	pos-
sibly divergent models. The issue is therefore not only 
to identify commonalities between projects, for instance, 
but	also	to	agree	that	 the	compromises	so	found	won’t	
diminish the value of the underlying idiosyncratic mod-
els,	the	specificity	of	any	single	project	or	interpretation.	
We believe that in the humanities this agreement is not 
necessarily reachable once for all or hoped for, because it 
may imply the negation of the interpretative efforts that 
make a work or a project unique and the negation of the 
evolutionary nature of scholarship. However, we also 
think that the possibility to make two incommensurable 
categorical systems communicate could be a challenge 
worth pursuing. 
Defining	humanities’	research	
As mentioned above, at a general level it is useful to 
characterize humanities scholarship by highlighting the 
points of contrast with the hard sciences. Humanities 
scholars are traditionally engaged with the expression of 
interpretative statements and the elaboration of debates 
on a disparate range of sources of knowledge, rather than 
with	the	seeking	of	firm	objective	schemas	or	universal	
taxonomies.	One	of	 the	authors	analyzed	more	specifi-
cally the characteristics of a humanities domain (Pasin 
et	al.,	2007)—philosophy—and	identified	those	key	el-
ements	 that	 define	 its	 scholarship	 and	make	 it	 hard	 to	
model. Some of these elements are outlined below: 
1. historical events, that is, events which are inherent-
ly time-dependent (e.g., the publication of a book, 
or	an	author’s	subscription	to	a	viewpoint);
2. generic uncertainty, that is the frequency of state-
ments about facts which cannot be located exactly 
in the time and space dimensions (e.g., the birth of 
Heraclitus);
3. information objects, i.e. texts in a semiotic sense 
and especially language-based information objects 
(e.g. a book), as they are the traditionally preferred 
medium philosophical contents are expressed with; 
4. interpretation events, intended as the process of 
attributing an abstract content to an information ob-
ject	(e.g.,	when	we	say	that	“Aristotle’s	fourth	book	
of the Metaphysics states an ontological principle”);
5. coexistence of contradictory information, which is 
a direct consequence of 4 (e.g., when people claim 
different or opposing views on the same proposi-
tion);
6. viewpoints, and other non-material entities (“philo-
sophical ideas”), for they are the objects philoso-
phers are usually engaged with by studying and ex-
pressing them. 
Although	philosophy	has	often	been	defined	as	the	queen	
of	 the	sciences,	 these	reflections	on	 its	nature	as	disci-
pline may not stand true for thehumanities as a whole. 
In order to highlight all the dimensions that make the 
modeling of humanities domains such a unique task, we 
surely need a thorough investigation of other humani-
ties’	 domains	 too.	 Furthermore,	 for	 space	 reasons	 we	
have deliberately not mentioned other works in the digi-
tal humanities, such as (Jones, 2006) and (Eide, 2008), 
where the issues tackled are remarkably similar to ours, 
although the approach is not necessarily ontology-ori-
ented. We intend to elaborate more on these topics in the 
final	version	of	the	paper.	
Conclusions 
In this extended abstract we addressed a number of prob-
lems emerging from the employment of semantic web 
technologies in humanities domains. In particular, we 
focused on the notion of ontologies for data-integration, 
highlighting the great challenges these technologies will 
bring especially	 to	 the	 digital	 humanities’	 practitioner.	
To this aim we also provided some examples from our 
previous research in the philosophical domain. In the 
final	paper	we	will	expand	 this	 research	also	by	draw-
ing from the results of a detailed analysis of the vari-
ous projects ongoing in our department. It is our hope 
that this research will stimulate further discussions and 
the formulation of a preliminary but comprehensive re-
search agenda.
