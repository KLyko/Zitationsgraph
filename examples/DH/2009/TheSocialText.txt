The Social Text as Digital 
Gamespace: or, what I learned 
from playing Spore

The meaning of video games is in their playing, in performance, which involves searching for signs 
of intelligence—human and machine-mediated—with 
which to collaborate or compete in making meanings. 
This happens in textual interpretation of all kinds, but the 
process is foregrounded and dramatized in video games 
in ways that make them useful models for textual schol-
arship, editing, and interpretation, considered in terms 
of scholarly content management systems or socially 
networked knowledge sites. For example: what I learned 
from	playing	Will	Wright’s	sim-everything	game,	Spore, 
is the importance of building asynchronous “pollination” 
systems that encourage complex improvisation by way 
of feedback loops, afford the search for and collabora-
tion with others (via their creations), the continual re-ed-
iting of shared materials, and preserve, track, and allow 
for the analysis of multiple individual edits.
