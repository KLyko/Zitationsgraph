Introduction 
The aim of this paper is to present a corpus-stylistic study of the collocation of gentleman in Dickens. 
The word gentleman is among the most frequent ‘con-
tent’	words	in	Dickens.	In	fact,	as	Fig.	1	shows,	gentle-
man appears more frequently in Dickens than in any oth-
er author examined, and thus is a key word in Dickens in 
the sense that it ‘appear[s] in a text or a part of a text with 
a frequency greater than chance occurrence alone would 
suggest’	(Henry	and	Rooseberry,	2001:	110).	
Fig. 1 Normalised frequency of gentleman per million 
words 
Building on my pilot study of the collocation of gentle-
man in Dickens and Smollett (Tabata, 2008), this study 
expands the scope of analysis by comparing Dickens 
texts with a larger refer ence corpus covering major eigh-
teenth- and nineteenth-century authors as well as by 
combining quantitative techniques with qualitative inter-
pretation	of	statistical	findings.	The	corpus,	upon	which	
the present study is based, is made up of three compo-
nents: 1) 24 Dickens text sets (4,835,158 words), 2) a 
set of 23 eighteenth-century texts (4,163,353 words: De-
foe, Fielding, Goldsmith, Richardson, Smollett, Sterne, 
and Swift), and 3) a set of 31 nineteenth-century texts 
(5,118,346 words: Austen, the Brontë sisters, Collins, 
George Eliot, Gaskell, Thackeray, and Trollope). The to-
tal of running words amount to 14,116,857. One might 
find	that	female	au	thors	outnumber	male	authors	in	the	
nineteenth-century set. However, the female set is not 
so overpopulated as to imbalance the population of the 
subcorpus. The total of the tokens by male authors ac-
counts for as high as 45 % of the running words due to 
comparatively thick volumes produced by male authors.

A few methodological issues 
To	investigate	Dickens’	stylistic	features	associated	with	
the use of gentleman, it will be appro priate to analyze 
the word in collocation, rather than in isolation since se-
mantics of a word is extended to the surrounding words, 
or co-text (Firth, 1957; Sinclair, 1991; Stubbs, 2001). 
The	first	 issue	 to	 be	 discussed	 is	 a	 collocational	 span.	
Although there is not a total agreement be tween linguists 
regarding an optimal range of collocational span, a gen-
erally accepted practice is to examine collocation in a 
span of four words to the each side of the node (Jones 
and	Sinclair,	1974).	This	is	based	on	the	finding	that	it	
will	become	increasingly	diffcult	to	find	meaningful	col-
locational pattens beyond a span of four words (Sinclair 
et al., 2004), as shown in Fig. 2.

positions 1–10*  
* From Sinclair (1969) as reprinted in Sinclair et al. 
(2004) 
Next comes the issue of how to measure collocational 
strength between words. If we use raw frequency (or 
normalised frequency) counts, the predominance of 
function words such as the, a, and, of, etc. (as evident 
in Table 1) would overcrowd subtler, more meaning-
ful patterns. My proposed solution is to use a statistical 
measure.	Among	a	number	of	techniques	for	filtering	out	
unimportant neighbouring words, a Mutual Information 
(MI) score measures collocational strength, by a loga-
rithmic compression of the frequency of collocates. It 
therefore is likely to spotlight semantic relationships 
rather than syntactic relationships between the node and 
its collocates. Mutual information score for the colloca-
tion of the word x and the word y (I
(x,y)
) is obtained from 
the formula (1).   
 
I
(x,y)
 = 
 
log
2
    f
(x,y)
 × N
                        f
(x)
 × f
(y)
 
The third issue is how we set a threshold for variables. 
Church and Hanks (1990: 24) state that the association 
ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small 
(for example, when f
x.y
	 ≤	 5).	My	 tentative	 proposal	 is	
to base analysis upon collocates occurring 10 times or 
more, and with MI scores higher than 3.0, drawing on 
Church	and	Hanks’	account	that	“pairs	with	I
(x,y)
 > 3 tend 
to be interesting” (24). Table 2 list 100 strongest collo-
cates with f
(x,y)
	≥	10.	A	close	 look	at	Table	2,	however,	
reveals that there are a few proper nouns that occur only 
in	a	particular	text	(Brass’s,	Greystock,	and	Oliver).	As	
a results of eliminating twelve such proper nouns from 
the candidates for variables, 378 collocates of gentleman 
were	found	qulified	as	variables.	The	initial	number	of	
texts	in	the	corpus	was	78,	but	one	text,	Smollett’s	The 
History and Adventures of an Atom (1769) did not meet 
the requirements and, therefore, was eliminated from the 
data set. 
The sheer volume of data to be analysed is daunting: a 
collocational strength matrix for 378 collocates across 
77 texts (77 rows by 378 columns). Since it would be 
extremely diffcult for a human eye to detect meaning-
ful patterns from the data of such dimensions, corre-
spondence analysis is employed to visualize complex 
interrelationships among gentleman’s	 collocates,	 in-
terrelationships among texts, and the association patterns 
between the gentleman’s	 collocates	 and	 texts	 in	multi-
dimensional spaces.

ful in elucidating linguistic vari ation over time, variation 
across registers, variation across oceans, to say noth-
ing of linguis tic differences between authors (Brainerd, 
1980; Burrows, 1987 & 1996; Biber and Fine gan, 1992; 
Craig, 1999a, b, & c; Hoover, 2003a, b, & c; Rudman, 
2005). My earlier at tempts used correspondence analysis 
to accommodate low frequency variables (words) in pro-
filing	 authorial/chronological/cross-register	 variations	
in Dickens and Smollett (Tabata, 2005; 2007a/b; 2008). 
Given the fact that most collocates of content words tend 
to be low in frequency, my methodology based on corre-
spondence analysis would usefully be applied to a mac-
roscopic analysis of collocation of gentleman.

Results 
Fig. 3 visualises interrelationships among 77 texts. Data 
points (texts) closer to each other in the diagram tend to 
have similar collocates in common. The greater the dis-
tance between texts, the less they have in common. Fig. 
4 indicates interrelationships among 378 collocates. The 
proportion accounted for by Dimensions 1 and 2 is only 
4.21 % and 3.03 %, respectively, of the total variance in 
the data, indicating the relationships among the matrix of 
77 rows by 378 columns are extremely complex. 
Fig. 3 provides an interesting overview of similarity or 
contrast between texts: the horizontal axis, the strongest 
variance in the data set, differentiates Dickens versus the 
eighteenth-and nineteenth-century authors. One seem-
ing anomaly as far as Dickens texts are concerned is the 
position of 1851_CHE, A Child’s History of England 
(1851),	which	finds	itself	between	the	eighteenth	and	the	
nineteenth century text groups. This history book writ-
ten for children is considerably different in style from 
other Dickensian works. Therefore it is not unexpected 
for this piece to be found least Dickensian as indicated 
by the vertical axis, a phenomenon in keeping with pre-
vious multivariate studies based on other linguistic vari-
ables, such as –ly adverbs (Tabata, 2005: 231) and part-
of-speech distribution (Tabata, 2002: 173). In addition, 
early Dickens texts are found in the lower half of the 
Dickens cluster, again in consistent with my other works 
(Tabata, 2008; 2009a; 2009b).

tury texts towards the upper half of the chart although 
the two sets are not in two distinct clusters. Fig. 4 corre-
sponds to Fig. 3 and thus tells us what words tend to co-
occur with gentleman in Dickens, in the eighteenth- and 
nineteenth-century texts. 
Concordance 
A close examination of Fig. 4 leads to an awareness that 
gentleman in Dickens are charac terised by (uncommon) 
adjectives while, in the eighteenth-century texts, verbs 
(of past tense) are prominent collocates. The nineteenth-
century texts do not display a particular pattern apart 
from words related to family or position. I would rather 
interpret this result as suggesting the nineteenth-century 
texts are negatively characterised both against the Dick-
ens set and the eighteenth-century set.

Fig. 6 Concordance: censorious 
A close study of gentleman in collocation with such 
Dickensian adjectives, egotistical, cen sorious, throwing-
off	makes	us	realize	Dicken’s	ironical	use	of	gentleman. 
Moreover, these concordance lines make us realize that 
in	Dickens	more	than	one	modifiers	are	likely	to	precede	
gentleman.	In	fact,	Fig.	8	illustrates	Dickens’s	tendency	
to use multiple adjectives. The increase in the proportion 
which Dickens instances occupy in ‘the multi-adjective 
gentleman’	from	‘a | an ADJ	ADJ	gentleman’,	as	well	as	
gentleman in total indicates that Dickens uses ‘the ADJ 
ADJ gentleman’	 formula	 as	 character	 appellations,	 in-
stead of simply referring to a character as a gentleman.

Conclusion 
What has emerged from this survey can be summarised 
as follows:
1. The most powerful solution obtained from multi-
variate analysis can be interpreted as demonstrating 
that Dickens has distinctive style in collocation of 
the word gentleman. 
2. Dickens is more likely to use adjectives in colloca-
tion with gentleman than the control set. Adjectives 
with higher MI scores often strike oxymoronic hu-
mour when collocating with gentleman in Dickens 
texts. 
3. In	Dickens,	modifier-collocates	(adjectives)	tend	to	
occur in succession (juxtaposition or concatenation) 
typically in early works. They are often employed as 
character appellation (variations of character-name)
