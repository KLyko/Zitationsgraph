It has become a critical commonplace that computa-tional studies have not achieved widespread accep-
tance in mainstream literary studies (Corns 1991, Potter 
1991, Fortier 1991, McGann 2001, Ramsay 2003, Rom-
mel 2004). It is also the case, however, that practitioners 
have tended to be cautious about the sorts of interpretive 
claims that can be made on the basis of statistical analy-
sis. Ramsay (2003) locates the source of the caution in 
a from of “dissonance” in the computing community 
where empirical studies are seen as providing a kind of 
safe haven that would be compromised if the researcher 
were to intervene excessively with either the data or the 
analysis (168).
The	view	of	computational	stylistics	as	“scientific”	and	
therefore irrelevant to mainstream literary criticism is 
a pervasive one. Scholars who are sympathetic to the 
methods involved in attribution and the analysis of style 
typically construct the problem of humanities comput-
ing relationship with the wider scholarly community in 
terms of a need for computing scholars to rethink their 
research such that it is framed in terms of “interesting” 
versus “right” (Ramsay 2003 173) or “interactive tool” 
versus “quantitative tool” (Sinclair 2003 177) or “dis-
ciplined play” versus “unity and coherence” (Rockwell 
2003 213). In constructing the debate in these terms there 
is a risk of amplifying whatever differences there may be 
between traditional humanities scholars and computing 
scholars. The result is that the perceived differences be-
come further entrenched. It also sidesteps the question of 
how and why attribution studies work.
Attitudes to what can be said about a text depend largely 
on the account of language that underpins an analysis 
(Connors 2006a; Hoover 2007). Cognitive grammar as 
developed by Ronald Langacker (1987, 1991) provides 
a	theory	that	justifies	the	counting	of	function	words	in	a	
computational analysis and also provides an interpretive 
framework that can explain the use of function words 
as a rhetorically motivated choice with semantic impli-
cations. As such it provides a promising theoretical ac-
count for the kinds of computational studies carried out

by Burrows (1987a, 1987b, 1992b), Craig (1999a, 2002, 
2004), Hoover (2003a, 2003b), Rybicki (2005), and oth-
ers.
This study explores the use of function words in an anal-
ysis of style of 60 tragedies published between 1580 and 
1641,	with	a	particular	 focus	on	Elizabeth	Cary’s,	The 
Tragedy of Mariam. The set is comprised of the 12 so-
called “Sidnean” closet tragedies, as well as 48 tragedies 
that were written for performance (See Appendix 1). 
Of these 5 were performed in private theatres and 41 in 
public theatres. It is not known whether the remaining 2 
were performed (Harbage & Schoenbaum, 1964). Some 
textual preparation was carried out prior to the analysis, 
but editing and coding was kept to a minimum. Although 
spelling was regulated homographs were not tagged. 
Contracted forms throughout the texts were expanded so 
that their constituents appeared as separate words.
Tagged texts were then run through a frequency count 
using a program developed by the Centre for Literary 
and Linguistic Computing (CLLC) at the University of 
Newcastle called Intelligent Archive (IA). A list of 241 
function words was used (see Appendix 2). This list was 
developed on the basis of work by the CLLC. Using IA a 
frequency test was run to establish which function words 
were most commonly found in each of the plays. The 
frequency count for each word in the function word list 
was expressed in the IA output as a percentage of the 
total dialogue in the relevant play. The data produced by 
IA were then transferred to Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences (SPSS), and Excel, for further analysis.
Figure 1. Principal component analysis for 60 tragedies 
(1580-1641) in 4000 word segments for 53 most 
discriminating function words – word plot for first two 
eigenvectors 
On the basis of strong discriminate analysis results an 
independent samples t test was carried out to identify a 
set of “closet” and “stage” markers (see appendix 3). The 
markers	were	only	selected	if	they	also	satisfied	both	the	
t test for equality of means and Mann Whitney test. A 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then carried 
out to identify which variables were responsible for most 
of the difference between the sets of texts. For the PCA, 
the texts were broken into 4000 word segments to ensure 
that results could be easily presented. Segments of less 
than 4000 words were incorporated into the preceding 
segment. This produced 268 segments in total (50 closet 
segments and 218 stage play segments). The results of 
the PCA are set out in Table 1 and Table 2.
Figure 2. Principal component analysis for 60 tragedies 
(1580-1641) in 4000 word segments for 53 most 
discriminating function words
One of the most interesting features of Figure 2 is the 
way	the	graph	identifies	three	loosely	clustered	generic	
groupings. These are closet plays to the east, public stage 
plays to the west, and private stage plays along with 
Mariam in the centre. Marta Straznicky (2004) analyses 
Mariam in the context of drama associated with the pri-
vate theatres. She notes that writers for the stage actively 
incorporated elements of the neo-Senecan tradition as-
sociated with closet tragedy into their plays. While some 
writers for the stage adopt various features commonly 
found in closet tragedy to a greater extent than their col-
leagues, Elizabeth Cary appears to draw on a more theat-
rical tradition than her closet contemporaries.
This	is	an	interesting	result	for	Elizabeth	Cary’s	play	be-
cause it supports the insights of more traditional humani-
ties scholars who have described Mariam as the most 
“theatrical” of the Sidnean closet tragedies (Barish 1993; 
Findlay, Williams & Hodgson-Wright 1999; Straznicky 
2004). The play features sub-plots, stage directions and 
action that is played out rather than dealt with through 
narrative.  Function word analysis supports the view of 
Mariam as one of the more theatrical of the closet texts, 
and provides additional information about how Mariam 
relates to contemporary texts in terms of the selected

variables.
One of the strongest differences between the plays writ-
ten for the stage, and closet plays, is the use of pronouns. 
There	is	evidence	of	frequent	usage	of	the	first	and	sec-
ond person singular pronouns in the stage plays and little 
evidence of their use in closet plays. Van Hoek (2007) 
has analysed pronouns from the perspective of Langack-
er’s	 cognitive	 grammar,	 particularly	 in	 relation	 to	 the	
way	they	influence	the	accessibility	of	concepts	and	the	
viewpoint from which constructions are understood. Van 
Hoek’s	 analysis	 can	 usefully	 explain	 aspects	 of	 closet	
tragedy and The Tragedy of Mariam which have caused 
readers	over	 time	to	find	the	text(s)	 less	engaging	than	
plays written for the public stage.
In a cognitive analysis, language that features frequent 
use of pronouns, particularly anaphoric pronouns, (such 
as him in	“I’ll	go	and	get	him”)	assumes	a	certain	com-
mon ground between the speaker and the addressee; they 
both understand who or what is being referred to without 
“him” being referred to by name. When a full-noun is 
used, like a name, there is an implied conceptual dis-
tance. The notion of “conceptual distance” also relates 
to how easily accessible a concept is for the discourse 
participants. 
In	her	first	soliloquy,	a	speech	of	seventy-five	lines,	Mar-
iam refers to herself by name four times. She asks her-
self	“then	why	grieves	Mariam	Herod’s	death	to	hear?”	
(I.i.38) and calls herself “heard-hearted Mariam” (I.i.62). 
In most situations it is unusual for a speaker to refer by 
name to himself or herself. When Mariam names her-
self, she places the conception of “Mariam” on the meta-
phorical stage shared between speaker and addressee. 
In cognitive linguistic terms, it is as though Mariam is 
observing	herself	from	an	outside	position.	It’s	a	device	
that breaks up the normal relationship between speaker 
and addressee and has a disorienting effect. 
In his analysis of the Senecan tradition in England, 
Braden asks “what makes it appropriate for a character 
to talk this way?” (1985 66). There could be a number 
of	reasons	for	Cary’s	characters	to	engage	in	this	type	of	
self-referential linguistic behaviour, however it is likely 
that the style of speech is rhetorically motivated. Al-
though the language of the play is somewhat alienating, 
it	 reflects	 serious	 philosophical,	 cultural	 and	 political	
ambitions. Mariam is explicitly concerned with the indi-
vidual’s	right	to	resist	tyranny.	The	form	this	resistance	
takes	reflects	 the	influence	of	neo-Stoic	discourses	and	
Seneca as literary and philosophical model.
For Braden the characteristic feature of Senecan drama 
is a kind of “cosmic self-dramatization” (178) that is 
represented in the characters by a quest for “a radical, 
unpredicated	independence”	(67).	The	speech	of	Cary’s	
characters can be linked to this very neo-Senecan idea of 
selfhood and the neo-Stoic ideals of control of the self, 
especially in the face of unchecked abuse of power. Mar-
iam’s	conquest	of	self	can	be	traced	through	the	way	she	
overcomes emotional confusion to become “free, lofty, 
fearless and steadfast” (Seneca qtd Straznicky 1994 
115). Evidence of this struggle in Mariam can be seen 
at multiple levels, including the linguistically at the level 
of function words.
