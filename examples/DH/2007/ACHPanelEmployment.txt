W hat sort of jobs are there in the field of DigitalHumanities and where are they? How do you prepare
for and get one? When you get one, what do you do? If you
teach, what and how? How can you make sure your work is
properly assessed? Where do you fit within the disciplinary
world of the university? Panelists from industry, research
centers, and academic programs will discuss these and related
issues briefly, leaving plenty of time for a general discussion.
